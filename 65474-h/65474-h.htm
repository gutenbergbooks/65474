<h2 class="nobreak">DEDICATION.</h2>

</div>

<p class="center"><span class="smaller">TO</span><br />
HIS EXCELLENCY<br />
<span class="larger">SIR H. B. E. FRERE, K.C.B.,</span><br />
GOVERNOR OF BOMBAY.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Dear Sir Bartle Frere</span>,</p>

<p>There is no time to ask your assent to
this dedication. But I have trust enough in your
love for old travellers, and in your good-will to the
editor, to venture it without permission. I have
some hope too that I introduce to you a new acquaintance
in the Bishop of Columbum, whose book
seems little known.</p>

<p>Like many other old travellers of more fame,
whilst endeavouring to speak only truth of what he
has seen, Jordanus retails fables enough from hearsay.
What he did see in his travels was so marvellous to
him, that he was quite ready to accept what was
told him of regions more remote from Christendom,
when it seemed but in reasonable proportion more
marvellous. If there were cats with wings in Malabar,<span class="pagenum">[ii]</span>
as he had seen,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> why should there not be people
with dogs’ heads in the Islands of the Ocean?<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> If
black men cut off their own heads before their gods
at Columbum,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> why should not “white and fat men”
be purchased as delectable food in Java?<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> If there
were rats nearly as big as foxes in India Major,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
why should there not be rocs that could fly away
with elephants in India Tertia?<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Apart from this credulity, it might be well if the
heads of some of our modern sojourners in India
could be endowed with a little more of that Organ
of Wonder which gave these old story-tellers such a
thorough enjoyment of the real marvels of the East,
and could by its help see something worthier there
than a howling wilderness, affording no consolation
but that silver fruit, which, like the coco-nut described
by our author, is borne twelve times in the
year.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Were Jordanus to come to life again, he would see
many changes no doubt, but he would still find many
landmarks standing after the five and a half centuries.
To say nothing of the “Coquodriles”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and the
horrible heat,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> he would find the Parsis still disposing
of their dead in their strange old fashion,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> the
Nairs still handing down their succession in oblique
descent,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> the Dóms still feeding on offal and doing
the basest drudgeries,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> the poor Poliars still dwelling<span class="pagenum">[iii]</span>
in dens and howling by the wayside,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> the ox still
“honoured like a father,”<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and the idols still “dragged
through the land like the Virgin at Rogationtides;”<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
he might even hear now and then of “living
women taking their places on the fire and dying with
their dead.”<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Much therefore of evil he would find
very persistent. How on the other side? He would
indeed also find the Hindus still “clean in feeding,”
but would he still pronounce them to be “true in
speech and eminent in justice?”<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Is it not to be
feared that he would find not only the wealth of that
Columbum, which in the days of his bishopric was
hidden by the masts of all the East from Yemen to
Cathay, as far gone by as the splendours of the kings
of Telinga and Narsinga, but the natural life and
genius of the people degenerate and their inborn arts
in decay? He would indeed see vigorous efforts in
action to introduce a new life into the country; instead
of Diabolus roaring in the woods by night<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> he
might hear the scream of the locomotive; and he
would meet among those Western conquerors who,
in strange fulfilment of the prophecies of his own
day,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> are now ruling India, some confident believers
in the renovation of the land through the introduction
of the material progress of Europe.</p>

<p>Will that belief be justified? I am not likely to
undervalue the work in which my best years have<span class="pagenum">[iv]</span>
been spent; but surely that alone will not serve.
The question that carried Jordanus to the East five
hundred and forty years ago is still the great question
for India, however Providence may solve it. Till
India becomes Christian there is no hope of real life
and renovation. Would Jordanus Redivivus discern
much progress in this direction since the days of his
episcopate? How like his talk about the matter is
to that of our own missionaries in the nineteenth
century!<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Hindu Christians are still a feeble and
scattered folk,<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and the advance towards Christian
light seems to all who care not, and to many who do
care, almost nothing. But it is encouraging to know
that you think very differently, and few indeed have
had at once your capacity and your opportunity for a
just judgment.</p>

<p>I am ever, dear Sir Bartle,</p>

<p class="center">Your faithful friend and servant,</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</h2>

</div>

<p>The little work here presented was printed in the
original Latin at Paris in 1839, under the editorship
of M. Coquebert-Montbret, in the <i>Recueil de
Voyages et de Mémoires, publié par la Société de Géographie</i>,
vol. iv.</p>

<p>I cannot find that it has ever been published or
translated in England, or even noticed in any English
book, except in the <i>Ceylon</i> of Sir James Emerson
Tennent, where there is an allusion to it.</p>

<p>The book itself does not add anything to our knowledge;
but the observations of a traveller who resided
in India so far back as the beginning of the fourteenth
century must be very dull indeed if sufficient
interest cannot be derived from their date to make
them acceptable. Nor do I think our author is dull,
whilst I regret that he is so brief, and has omitted so
much that he might really have laid up as an addition
to our knowledge. The very fact that there
were Roman Catholic missionaries and a bishop in
India at that period, just between the days of Marco
Polo and those of Ibn Batuta, may indeed be excavated
from old ecclesiastical chronicles; but it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_iv"></a>[iv]</span>
certainly unfamiliar to the knowledge of those who
do not dig in such mines.</p>

<p>The translation which follows has been made, and
the brief particulars which I shall give respecting
the author have been derived, from the <i>Recueil</i> above
indicated.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>The manuscript from which the French editor
transcribed belonged to the Baron Walckenaer. It
is on parchment, of the fourteenth century, and contains
other matter, the work of Jordanus occupying
twenty-nine quarto pages.</p>

<p>The author is termed a native of Séverac. That
he was a Frenchman will appear from several passages
in his book. But there are at least five places
of the name of Séverac in France. Three of these
are in the district of Rouergue, in the department of
the Aveyron (near the eastern boundary of the old
province of Guyenne, and some ninety miles N.E.
of Toulouse), and it was probably from one of
these that he came. There was a noble family of
this province called De Séverac, of which was
Amaulry de Séverac, Marshal of France in the time
of Charles VII. But, as will afterwards appear, our
traveller was called <i>Catalani</i>.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_v"></a>[v]</span></p>

<p>The dates of his birth, his death, or his first going
to the East, are undetermined. But it is ascertained
that he was in the East in 1321-1323, that he returned
to Europe, and started again for India, in or
soon after 1330. There appears to be nothing to
determine whether this book of <i>Mirabilia</i> was written
on his first, or on a subsequent, return to Europe.</p>

<p>The authorities for the dates just given are the
following:—</p>

<p>Two letters from Jordanus are found in a MS. in
the national library at Paris (in 1839,—Bibliothèque
du Roi—MS. No. 5,006, p. 182), entitled <i>Liber de
ætatibus</i>, etc. The first of these is dated from Caga,<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
12th October, 1321. It is addressed to members of
his own order (the Dominican) and of that of St.
Francis, residing at Tauris, Tongan, and Marogo,<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
and points out three stations adapted for the establishment
of missions, viz., Supera, Paroco, and
Columbum. On the receipt of these letters, Nicolaus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span>
Romanus, who was Vice-Custos of the Dominicans
in Persia, is stated to have started for India.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>In his second letter, dated in January, 1324, Jordanus
relates how he had started from Tabriz to go
to Cathay, but embarked first for Columbum with
four Franciscan missionaries, and how they were
driven by a storm to Tana,<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> in India, where they
were received by the Nestorians. There he left his
companions, and started for Baroch, where he hoped
to preach with success, as he was better acquainted
with the Persian tongue than the others were. Being
detained however at Supera, he there heard that his
four brethren at Tana had been arrested, and returned
to aid them, but found them already put to
death. He was enabled to remove the bodies of
these martyrs by the help of a young Genoese
whom he found at Tana, and, having transported<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii"></a>[vii]</span>
them to Supera, he buried them in a church there as
honourably as he could.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>The only remaining date in the biography of Jordanus
is derived from a bull of Pope John XXII.,
the date of which is equivalent to 5th April 1330,
addressed to the Christians of Columbum, and intended
to be delivered to them by Jordanus, who was
nominated bishop of that place. The bull commences
as follows:—<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Nobili viro domino Nascarinorum et universis sub eo
Christianis Nascarinis de Columbo, Venerabilem fratrem
nostrum Jordanum Catalani, episcopum Columbensem, Prædicatorum
Ordinis professorem, quem nuper ad episcopalis
dignitatis apicem auctoritate apostolicâ duximus promovendum⸺”
etc.</p>
</div>

<p>The Pope goes on to recommend the missionaries
to their good-will, and ends by inviting the Nascarini
(<i>Nazrání</i>, Christians, in India) to abjure their schism,
and enter the unity of the Catholic Church.</p>

<p>The Pope had shortly before nominated John de
Core to be Archbishop of Sultania in Persia. This
metropolitan had, at least, three bishops under him,
viz., of Tabriz, of Semiscat, and of Columbum.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span>
The two latter were entrusted by the Pope with the
<i>Pallium</i> for the archbishop. Sultania, between Tabriz
and Tehran, was the seat of the Persian kings previous
to the Tartar conquest in the thirteenth century,
and was still a great centre of commerce between the
Indies and Europe. The number of Christians was
so great, that they had in this city, it is said, four
hundred churches. (?)<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>We may suppose that Jordanus, after fulfilling his
commission at Sultania, proceeded to his see in
Malabar by the Persian Gulf, the route which he had
followed on his first visit to India; but whether he
ever reached it, or ever returned from it, seems to be
undetermined.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> M. Coquebert-Montbret assumes
that he did both; but as far as I can gather, this is
based on the other assumption, that his <i>Mirabilia</i> was
written <i>after</i> returning a second time. My impression
is that it was written <i>before</i> he went out as
bishop, for it contains no allusion to his having held<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ix"></a>[ix]</span>
that dignity. Nor does it appear to be known
whether he had any successor in his episcopate.</p>

<p>Another work appears to have been traced with
some plausibility to our author. It is a chronicle
composed in the fourteenth century, and quoted by
Muratori from a MS. which in 1740 existed in the
Vatican library, with the No. 1960. It is adorned
with fine miniatures, and is entitled</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Satyrica gestarum rerum, regum et regnorum, atque
summorum pontificum, historia, à creatione mundi usque ad
Henricum VII. Romanum augustum.”</p>
</div>

<p>The chronicle ends with the year 1320, and purports
to be written by one <i>Jordanus</i>. The passage
which is considered to identify him with our author
is one relating to the martyrdom of four Minor Friars
at Tana, and is so interesting in itself as to be worth
quoting at length. It is very perplexing, that though
several of the circumstances appear to identify his
narrative with that which forms the subject of our
author’s letter quoted in a previous page, the dates
are irreconcilable. This difficulty the French editor
does not notice, nor can I solve it.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x"></a>[x]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Mdcccxix.</span> Pope John read in the consistory, with
great approval, a letter which he had received, to the effect
following: To wit, that certain brethren of the orders of
Minors and Preachers, who had been sent on a mission to
Ormus to preach the faith to the infidels, when they found
that they could do no good there, thought it well to go over
to Columbum in India. And when they arrived at the
island called Dyo,<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> the brethren of the order of Minors
separated from the rest of the party, both Preachers and
secular Christians, and set out by land to a place called
Thana, that they might there take ship for Columbum.
Now there was at that place a certain Saracen of Alexandria,
Ysufus<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> by name, and he summoned them to the presence
of Melich, the governor of the land, to make inquest how
and why they were come. Being thus summoned, he
demands: what manner of men are ye called? They made
answer, that they were Franks, devoted to holy poverty, and
anxious to visit St. Thomas. Then, being questioned concerning
their faith, they replied that they were true Christians,
and uttered many things with holy fervour regarding
the faith of Christ. But when Melich let them go, the aforesaid
Yusuf a second and a third time persuaded him to
arrest and detain them. At length Melich and the Cadi
and the people of the place were assembled, Pagans and
idolaters as well as Saracens, and questioned the brethren:
How can Christ, whom ye call the Virgin’s son, be the son
of God, seeing that God hath not a mate? Then set they
forth many instances of divine generation, as from the sun’s
rays, from trees, from germs in the soil; so that the infidels
could not resist the Spirit who spake in them. But the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xi"></a>[xi]</span>
Saracens kindled a great fire, and said: Ye say that your
law is better than the law of Mahomet; an it be so, go ye
into the fire, and by miracle prove your words. The
brethren replied that, for the honour of Christ, that they
would freely do; and brother Thomas coming forward
would first go in, but the Saracens suffered him not, for
that he seemed older than the others; then came forward
the youngest of the brethren, James of Padua, a young
wrestler for Christ, and incontinently went into the fire, and
abode in it until it was well nigh spent, rejoicing and
uttering praise, and without any burning of his hair even,
or of the cloth of his gown. Now they who stood by shouted
with a great cry, Verily these be good and holy men!</p>

<p>“But the Cadi, willing to deny so glorious a miracle,
said: It is not as ye think, but his raiment came from the
land of Aben ...<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> a great friend of God, who when cast
into the flames in Chaldea, took no hurt; therefore, hath
this man abode scatheless in the fire.</p>

<p>“Then stripped they the innocent youth, and all naked
as he was born was he cast by four men into the fire. But
he bore the flames without hurt, and went forth from the
fire unscathed and rejoicing. Then Melich set them free to
go whither they would. But the Cadi, and the aforesaid
Yusuf, full of malice, knowing that they had been entertained
in the house of a certain Christian, said to Melich:
What dost thou? why slayest thou not these Christ-worshipers?
He replied: That I find no cause of death in them.
But they say: If ye let them go, all will believe in Christ,
and the law of Mahomet will be utterly destroyed. Melich
again says: What will ye that I should do, seeing that I find<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii"></a>[xii]</span>
no cause of death? But they said: His blood be upon us.
For it is said that if one cannot go pilgrim to Mecca, let
him slay a Christian and he shall obtain a full remission of
sins, as if he had visited Mecca. Wherefore, the night following,
the three men aforesaid, Melich, the Cadi, and
Yusuf, sent officers who despatched the three brethren,
Thomas, James, and Demetrius, to the joys of heaven,
bearing the palm of martyrdom. And after awhile, having
made brother Peter, who was in another place, present himself
before them, when he firmly held to the faith of Christ, for
two days they vexed him with sore afflictions, and on the
third day, cutting off his head, accomplished his martyrdom.
But their comrades, the Preachers and the rest, when they
heard this, wrote to the West, lamenting wofully that they
had been parted from the company of the holy martyrs, and
saying that they were devoutly engaged in recovering the
relics of the martyrs.”</p>
</div>

<p>I had desired to add to this preface some notices
of the Christians of Malabar, embracing the latest
information; but my work is cut short by circumstances,
and I must content myself with saying something,
hurriedly put together, as to the identity of
<i>Columbum</i>, the seat of the bishop’s see.</p>

<p>It is clear that Columbum is not Colombo in Ceylon,
though the French editor is wrong in supposing that
the latter city did not exist in the time of Jordanus, for
it is mentioned by the modern name in Ibn Batuta’s
travels, only a few years later. Jordanus evidently
does not speak of Ceylon as one who had been there,
and whilst treating of greater India, he says distinctly,
“<i>In istâ Indiâ, me existente in Columbo, fuerunt
inventi</i>,” <i>etc.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiii"></a>[xiii]</span></p>

<p>The identity of Columbum with Kulam or Quilon,
on the coast of Malabar (now in Travancore), might
therefore have been assumed, but for the doubts
which have been raised by some of the editors of
Marco Polo as to the position of the <i>Kulam</i> or <i>Coilon</i>
of Marco and other medieval travellers.</p>

<p>Mr. Hugh Murray, adopting the view of Count
Baldello Boni in his edition of Marco Polo, considers
that the place so-called by those travellers was on
the east coast of the Peninsula. I have not time to
seek for Baldello’s edition, and do not know his arguments;
but I conceive that there is enough evidence
to show that he is wrong.</p>

<p>The argument on which Murray rests is chiefly the
position in which Polo introduces his description of
Coilon, after Maabar, and before Comari; Maabar
being with him an extensive region of Coromandel,
and Comari doubtless the country about Cape
Comorin. But, omitting detailed discussion of the value
of this argument, which would involve a consideration
of all the other difficulties in reducing to geographical
order Polo’s notices of the kingdoms on the coast of
India, his description of Coilon as a great port for
pepper and brazil-wood, is sufficient to identify it as
on the coast of Malabar. The existence of places
called Coulan on the east coast in the maps of
D’Anville, Rennel, and Milburn, is of little moment,
for an inspection of the “Atlas of India” will show
scores of places so-called on both sides of Cape
Comorin, the word signifying, in the Tamul tongue,
‘an irrigation tank, formed by damming up natural<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiv"></a>[xiv]</span>
hollows.’ Indeed, though I have found no trace of
any well-known port on the east coast so-called, there
were at least four ports of the name on the west
coast frequented by foreign vessels, viz., Cote Colam,
north of Cananore; Colam, called Pandarani, north
of Calicut; Cai-Colam, or Kaincolam,<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> between
Cochin and the chief place of the name; Coulam,
or Quilon, the Columbum of our author.</p>

<p>We know that Kulam, on the coast of Malabar,
was founded in the ninth century, and that its foundation
formed an era from which dates were reckoned
in Malabar.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> In that same century we find<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> that the
sailing directions for ships making the China voyage
from the Persian Gulf, were to go straight from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xv"></a>[xv]</span>
Maskát to <i>Kulam Malé</i>, a place evidently, both from
name and fact, on the coast of Malabar. Here there
was a custom-house, where ships from China paid
their dues.</p>

<p>The narrative of Rabbi Benjamin of Tudela is
very hazy. He calls <i>Chulan</i> only seven days from
El-Cathif (which is a port on the west coast of the
Persian Gulf), “and on the confines of the country
of the Sun-worshippers.” However, his description
of the pepper-gardens adjoining the city, the black
Jews, etc., identify it with one of the Kulams on the
Malabar coast, and doubtless with Quilon, which was
the chief of them.</p>

<p>Then comes Polo’s notice of Coilon already alluded
to, followed by our author’s mention of it, and residence
there.</p>

<p>It is probable that the Polumbrum or Polembum
of his contemporaries Odoricus and Mandevill, are
corrupt readings of the name of Kulam or Columbum.
The former describes this place as at the head of the
pepper forest towards the south, and as abounding in
all sorts of merchandize; Mandevill adding, “thither
go merchants often from Venice to buy pepper and
ginger.”</p>

<p>Ibn Batuta, only half a century after Polo, is quite
clear in his description of <i>Kaulam</i>, as the seat of an
infidel king, the last city on the Malabar coast, and
frequented by many Mahomedan merchants. He
also says that Kaulam, Calicut, and Hílí were the
only ports entered by the ships of China.</p>

<p>So also Conti, early in the fifteenth century, on his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvi"></a>[xvi]</span>
return from the Eastern Archipelago, departing from
Champa (Cambodia), doubtless in one of those same
ships of China, after a month’s voyage arrives at
<i>Coloen</i>, a noble city, three days from Cochin, and
“situated in the province called Melibaria.”</p>

<p>Coming down to later times, Barbosa, in the first
years of the sixteenth century, speaks of Coulon still
as the great pepper port, the seat of one of the three
(chief) kings of Malabar, and where lived many
Moors, Gentiles, and Christians, who were great merchants,
and had many ships trading to Coromandel,
Ceylon, Bengal, Pegu, Malacca, Sumatra, etc.</p>

<p>Here, however, at last, we find something to
justify Marco Polo in regard to the position in which
he introduces the kingdom of Coilon. For, after
speaking of Coulam on the Malabar coast, Barbosa
goes forward to Cape Comorin, where he says the
country of Malabar indeed terminates, but the “aforesaid
kingdom of Coulam” still goes on and comes to
an end at the city of Cail, where the King of Coulam
made his continual residence. So also the “Summary
of kingdoms,” etc., in Ramusio, describes the
kingdom of Colam as extending on both sides of Cape
Comorin.</p>

<p>It is intelligible, therefore, that Marco, coming
upon territory belonging to the <i>kingdom</i> of Coilon,
before reaching Cape Comorin, should proceed to
speak of the city of that name, though it lay upon
the western coast. But there is in this no ground
for asserting, as Mr. Murray does, that “the <i>place</i> of
that name described by Marco and other early Europeans<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xvii"></a>[xvii]</span>
lay to the east of that great promontory.”
We have seen that a regular catena of authorities,
from the ninth to the sixteenth century, concurs in
representing Coulam, Kulam, Coloen, Coilon (<i>Quilon</i>),
on the coast of Malabar, as the great entrepôt of
trade with east and west, and there can be no reasonable
doubt that this is the Columbum which was the
seat of our author’s mission.</p>

<p>The occasional quotations given in the notes will
indicate the quality of the author’s Latin. The
French editor is unwilling to believe that episcopal
Latinity could be so bad, and suggests that his vernacular
was Latinized by some humbler scribe, and
probably extracted from a larger work. In support
of this, he adduces the abrupt commencement, and
the “but” with which he plunges in—“Inter Siciliam
<i>autem</i> et Calabriam.” But he gives a fac-simile of
the beginning of the MS., and the words seem to me
(all inexpert I confess) almost certainly to be “Inter
Siciliam <i>atque</i> Calabriam,” so that this argument is
null.</p>

<p>One must notice the frequent extraordinary coincidences
of statement, and almost of expression,
between this and other travellers of the same age,
especially M. Polo. At first one would think that
Jordanus had Polo’s book. But he certainly had not
Ibn Batuta’s, and the coincidences with him are
sometimes almost as striking. Had those ancient
worthies, then, a <span class="smcap">Murray</span> from whom they pilfered
experiences, as modern travellers do? I think they
had; but <i>their</i> Murray lay in the traditional yarns of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xviii"></a>[xviii]</span>
the Arab sailors with whom they voyaged, some of
which seem to have been handed down steadily from
the time of Ptolemy—peradventure of Herodotus<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>—almost
to our own day.</p>

<p>And so I commend the simple and zealous Jordanus
to kindly entertainment.</p>

I should have allowed, had time permitted of the search for further

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_23" href="#FNanchor_23" class="label">[23]</a> The French editor regards this as his surname. Is it not more

Persia, on the Persian Gulf,” (<i>French Editor</i>). Speaking without
having seen the letter, I should rather suspect it to be the island
and roadstead of <i>Karrack</i>, called by the Arabs <i>Khârej</i>, but also
locally, as appears by the Government charts, <i>Khárg</i>. (My friend
Mr. Badger thinks it may be <i>El-Kât</i>, an ancient port still much
frequented, fifty miles south-west of the mouth of the Euphrates.)
I find from M. D’Avezac in <i>Rec. de Voyages</i>, (iv. 421), that this
letter is published in <i>Quétif &amp; Echard</i>, Scriptoris Ordinis Dom., i.
p. 549, and that the second letter is given by <i>Wadding</i>, <i>Annales

there; and <i>Marogo</i> is Maragha in the plain east of Lake

<p><a id="Footnote_26" href="#FNanchor_26" class="label">[26]</a> Which shows that the places indicated by Jordanus were in
India. Paroco is of course Baroch, and Columbum, Coulam or
Quilon. Respecting the identity of this last we shall, however,
have to speak more fully. Supera, the French editor states, after
D’Anville, to be “the port now called Sefer, the <i>Sefara el Hind</i>
of the Arabs.” It is doubtless the Supara of Ptolomy, which he
places on the north of the first great river south of the Namadus
or Nerbudda. Masudi also says that Sefara was four days’ journey
from Cambay. These indications fix Supera on the Tapti,
over against Surat, and probably as the ancient representative of
that port. (See Reinaud’s <i>Mém. sur la Géog. de l’Inde</i>, and Vincent’s
<i>Periplus of the Erythræan Sea</i>, p. 385.)</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_28" href="#FNanchor_28" class="label">[28]</a> According to the Acta Sanctorum of the Bollandists, this martyrdom
took place, 1st April 1322. There is a letter from Francis
of Pisa (I presume in the MS. above quoted), a comrade and
friend of Jordanus, which gives similar details. They are also
found in the <i>Bibliotheca Hispanica Vetus</i> of <i>Nicol. Antonio</i>, p.

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_30" href="#FNanchor_30" class="label">[30]</a> The French editor supposes <i>Semiscat</i> to be, perhaps, a misreading
for Samirkat = <i>Samarkand</i>. Mr. Badger suggests judiciously
<i>Someisât</i>, the ancient Samosata. There was another see
under Sultania, <i>viz.</i>, Verna, supposed by D’Avezac to be Orna or
Ornas, which he identifies with Tana, the seat of a Venetian factory
at the mouth of the Don, on the site of ancient Tanais. (<i>Rec.
de Voy.</i>, iv. 510.)</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_31" href="#FNanchor_31" class="label">[31]</a> The editor does not give his authority for this. Sultania was
destroyed by Tamerlane, and never recovered its former importance.
It was still a city of some size in the time of Chardin,
but is now apparently quite deserted. It is not mentioned by
M. Polo.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_32" href="#FNanchor_32" class="label">[32]</a> I conclude, from a passage near the end of the work (ch. xiv.),
that the actual residence of Jordanus at Columbum, previous to
his writing, lasted only a year, or thereabouts.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_33" href="#FNanchor_33" class="label">[33]</a> I have now no doubt that the date in the next line is wrong.
For, according to M. D’Avezac (in the same volume of the <i>Rec. de
Voyages</i>, which contains Jordanus, p. 417), the celebrated traveller
Odoricus of Friuli, who was at Tana in 1322, sent home a letter
describing this martyrdom as having occurred in the preceding
year. It is in the Bib. Royale (now Impériale) at Paris. The narrative,
in still greater detail than here, is indeed to be found in the
Itinerary of Odoricus, as published in Hakluyt, at least in the
Latin; the English translation does not give the details. From
this error in date, as well as the better style of Latin, I should
doubt if this chronicle was written by our Jordanus.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_36" href="#FNanchor_36" class="label">[36]</a> <i>Sic.</i> I suppose it should be Abraham, according to the well-known
Mussulman tradition; perhaps called, as Mr. Badger kindly
suggests, <i>Aben</i> (or Ibn) <i>Azer</i>, the son of Azer, the Mussulman
name for Terah.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_37" href="#FNanchor_37" class="label">[37]</a> In Keith Johnstone’s new and beautiful atlas Quilon is identified
with Kayan or Kain-Kulam. This, I have no doubt, is quite
a mistake. The places, though near, are quite distinct, and in the
beginning of the sixteenth century were under distinct sovereigns.
I may here notice what I venture, with respect, to think is an error
in Mr. Major’s edition of Conti (<i>India in the Fifteenth Century</i>).
Conti, on his first arrival in Malabar, lands at “Pudefitania,” and,
after describing his visit to Bengal, and his ascent of the Ganges,
returns to Pudefitania. Mr. Major interprets this in the last place
<i>Burdwan</i>. But, apart from other arguments, it is evidently in both
passages the same place, <i>i.e.</i>, <i>Pudipatanam</i>, one of the old forgotten
ports on the coast of Malabar, but mentioned by Barbosa and
the Geographer in Ramusio. Other names mentioned by Conti are
in need of examination. <i>Maarazia</i>, the great city on the Ganges
which he visits, is certainly not <i>Muttra</i>, as the editor has it, but
Benares. The Braminical name, <i>Baranási</i>, is near enough to
Conti’s.</p>

<p>1. Between Sicily and Calabria there is a marvel in the
sea. This is it: on one side the sea runneth with an upward
current, and on the other side cometh down towards the
island with a swifter stream than any river; and so in the
middle is caused a wondrous eddy, sucking down ships that
hap to fall in with it, whatever be their bigness. And ’tis
said that in the bottom of the sea there is a horrid kind of a
whirlpool, from which the water cometh forth so wondrous
dark that even the fishes nowhere dare to come near it.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

sometimes four times, sometimes oftener, like a rapid river;
and that is a marvel to be sure!<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>3. I was at Thebes, where there be so many earthquakes
that nobody could believe it who had not felt them; for it

<span class="smaller">HERE FOLLOWETH CONCERNING ARMENIA.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>1. In Armenia the Greater I saw one great marvel. This
is it: a mountain of excessive height and immense extent,
on which Noah’s ark is said to have rested. This mountain
is never without snow, and seldom or never without clouds,
which rarely rise higher than three parts up. The mountain
is inaccessible, and there never has been anybody who could
get farther than the edge of the snow.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> And (marvellous
indeed!) even the beasts chased by the huntsmen, when they
come to the snow, will liefer turn, will liefer yield them into
the huntsmen’s hands, than go farther up that mountain.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
This mountain hath a compass of more than three days
journey for a man on horseback going without halt. There
be serpents of a great size, which swallow hares alive and
whole, as I heard from a certain trustworthy gentleman who
saw the fact, and shot an arrow at a serpent with a hare in
his mouth, but scathed it not.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> In a certain part of the
mountain is a dwelling which Noah is said to have built on
leaving the ark; and there, too, is said to be that original
vine which Noah planted, and whereby he got drunk; and
it giveth such huge branches of grapes as you would scarce
believe. This I heard from a certain Catholic archbishop of
ours, a great man and a powerful, and trustworthy to boot,
the lord of that land; and, indeed, I believe I have been at
the place myself, but it was in the winter season.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>2. This country of Armenia the Greater is very extensive,
and there three of the apostles suffered martyrdom: Bartholomew,
Simon, and Judas. I saw a prison in which the two
latter apostles were kept; and likewise springs of water
which they produced from the living rock, smiting it with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
a rod VIII times, or X times, or XVII times (anyhow
there be just as many springs as there were blows struck);
and hard by there was a church built, beauteous and of
wonderful bigness.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>3. In this same Armenia the Greater a certain glorious
virgin suffered martyrdom, the daughter of a king, and Scala
by name.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> And there, too, was cast into a well, with a lion
and a dragon, St. Gregory, who converted Armenia to the
Catholic faith, as well as its king Tertal,<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> in the time of
St. Sylvester and the Emperor Constantine.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> In this Armenia,
too, was slain the blessed martyr Jacobus.</p>

<p>4. This province is inhabited chiefly by schismatic Armenians,
but the Preaching and Minor friars have converted a
good four thousand of them, and more. For one archbishop,
a great man, called the Lord Zachary, was converted with
his whole people; and we trust in the Lord that in a short<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
time the whole residue shall be converted also, if only the
good friars go on so.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>5. There are many good and great Armenian princes,
Christians; but the Persian emperor hath the paramount
sovereignty.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>6. In this Armenia there is a Dead Sea, very bitter to the
taste, where they say there be no fish at all, and which cannot
be sailed upon by reason of the stench; and it has an
island where are buried many ancient emperors and kings
of the Persians, with an infinity of treasure; but nobody is
allowed to go there, or, if allowed, they dare not search for
the treasure.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>7. This Armenia extendeth in length from Sebast to the
Plain of Mogan and the Caspian Mountains; and in breadth
from the Barcarian Mountains to Tabriz,<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> which is a good
twenty-three days’ journey, the length being more than forty
days.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span></p>

<p>8. There is a certain lake, at the foot of the aforesaid
great mountain, where ten thousand martyrs were martyred,
and in their martyrdom happened all the same tokens
as in the Passion of Christ, for that they all were crucified
for Christ.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> And that part of the mountain is called Ararat;
and there was a city there called Semur, exceeding great,
which was destroyed by the Tartars.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> I have been over all
that country,—almost.</p>

<p>9. But I saw not anything else, in this Armenia the
greater, worth telling as a marvel.</p>

</div>

<p>1. In Persia, however, I saw a very marvellous thing: to
wit, that in Tabriz, which is a very great city, containing as
many as two hundred thousand houses,<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> dew never falls<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
from heaven; nor doth it rain in summer as in most parts it
doth, but they water artificially everything that is grown for
man’s food.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> There also, or thereabouts, on a kind of willows,
are found certain little worms, which emit a liquid
which congeals upon the leaves of the tree, and also drops
upon the ground, white like wax; and that excretion is
sweeter than honey and the honeycomb.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>2. There we have a fine-enough church, and about a thousand
of the schismatics converted to our faith, and about as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
many also in Ur of the Chaldees, where Abraham was born,
which is a very opulent city, distant about two days from
Tabriz.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>3. Likewise also at Sultania we have five hundred, or
five hundred and fifty. This is eight days’ distant from
Tabriz, and we have a very fine church there.</p>

<p>4. In this country of Persia are certain animals called
<i>onagri</i>, which are like little asses, but swifter in speed than
our horses.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>5. This Persia is inhabited by Saracens and Saracenized
Tartars, and by schismatic Christians of divers sects, such as
Nestorians, Jacobites, Greeks, Georgians, Armenians, and
by a few Jews. Persia hath abundance of silk, and also of
ultramarine,<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> but they wot not how to prepare it. They
have likewise exceeding much gold in the rivers, but they
wot not how to extract it, nor be they worthy to do so.</p>

<p>6. Persia extendeth about V<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> days’ journey in length,
and as much in breadth. The people of this realm live all
too uncleanly, for they sit upon the ground, and eke eat
upon the same, putting mess and meats<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> in a trencher for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
three, four, or five persons together. They eat not on a
table-cloth,<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> but on a round sheet of leather, or on a low
table of wood or brass, with three legs. And so six, seven,
or eight persons eat out of one dish, and that with their
hands and fingers; big and little, male and female, all eat
after this fashion. And after they have eaten, or even whilst
in the middle of their eating, they lick their fingers with
tongue and lips, and wipe them on their sleeves,<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> and afterwards,
if any grease still remains upon their hands, they
wipe them on their shoes. And thus do the folk over all
those countries, including Western and Eastern Tartary,
except the Hindus, who eat decently enough, though they
too eat with their hands.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>7. In Persia are some springs, from which flows a kind of
pitch, which is called <i>kic</i><a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> (<i>pix</i>, <i>dico</i>, <i>seu Pegua</i>), with
which they smear the skins in which wine is carried and
stored.</p>

<p>8. Between this country of Persia and India the Less is a
certain region where manna falls in a very great quantity,
white as snow, sweeter than all other sweet things, delicious,
and of an admirable and incredible efficacy. There
are also sandhills in great numbers, and very destructive to
men; for when the wind blows, the sand flows down just
like water from a tank.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> These countries aforesaid, to wit,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
Persia, Armenia Major, Chaldeia, as well as Cappadocia and
Asia Minor and Greece, abound in good fruits, meats, and
other things, like our own country; but their lands are not
so populous,—no, not a tithe,—except Greece.</p>

<p>2. In this lesser India are many things worthy to be noted
with wonder; for there are no springs, no rivers, no ponds;
nor does it ever rain, except during three months, viz.,
between the middle of May and the middle of August; and
(wonderful!) notwithstanding this, the soil is most kindly
and fertile, and during the nine months of the year in which
it does not rain, so much dew is found every day upon the
ground that it is not dried up by the sun’s rays till the middle
of the third hour of the day.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>3. Here be many and boundless marvels; and in this First
India beginneth, as it were, another world; for the men and
women be all black, and they have for covering nothing but
a strip of cotton tied round the loins, and the end of it flung
over the naked back. Wheaten bread is there not eaten by
the natives, although wheat they have in plenty; but rice is
eaten with its seasoning,<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> only boiled in water. And they
have milk and butter and oil, which they often eat uncooked.
In this India there be no horses, nor mules, nor camels, nor
elephants; but only kine, with which they do all their doings
that they have to do, whether it be riding, or carrying, or
field labour. The asses are few in number and very small,
and not much worth.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>4. The days and nights do not vary there more than by
two hours at the most.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<p>5. There be always fruits and flowers there, divers trees,
and fruits of divers kinds; for (example) there are some trees
which bear very big fruit, called <i>Chaqui</i>; and the fruit is of
such size that one is enough for five persons.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<p>6. There is another tree which has fruit like that just
named, and it is called <i>Bloqui</i>, quite as big and as sweet, but
not of the same species. These fruits never grow upon the
twigs, for these are not able to bear their weight, but only
from the main branches, and even from the trunk of the tree
itself, down to the very roots.</p>

<p>7. There is another tree which has fruit like a plum, but
a very big one, which is called <i>Aniba</i>. This is a fruit so
sweet and delicious as it is impossible to utter in words.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>8. There be many other fruit trees of divers kinds, which
it would be tedious to describe in detail.</p>

<p>9. I will only say this much, that this India, as regards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
fruit and other things, is entirely different from Christendom;
except, indeed, that there be lemons there, in some places,
as sweet as sugar, whilst there be other lemons sour like
ours.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> There be also pomegranates, but very poor and small.
There be but few vines, and they make from them no wine,
but eat the fresh grapes; albeit there are a number of other
trees whose sap they collect, and it standeth in place of wine
to them.</p>

<p>10. First of these is a certain tree called <i>Nargil</i>;<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> which
tree every month in the year sends out a beautiful frond like
[that of] a [date] palm-tree, which frond or branch produces
very large fruit, as big as a man’s head. There often grow
on one such stem thirty of those fruits as big as I have said.
And both flowers and fruits are produced at the same time,
beginning with the first month and going up gradually to
the twelfth; so that there are flowers and fruit in eleven
stages of growth to be seen together. A wonder! and a
thing which cannot be well understood without being witnessed.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
From these branches and fruits is drawn a very
sweet water. The kernel [at first] is very tender and pleasant
to eat; afterwards it waxeth harder, and a milk is drawn
from it as good as milk of almonds; and when the kernel
waxeth harder still, an oil is made from it of great medicinal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
virtue. And if any one careth not to have fruit, when the
fruit-bearing stem is one or two months old he maketh a cut
in it, and bindeth a pot to this incision; and so the sap,
which would have been converted into fruit, drops in; and
it is white like milk, and sweet like must, and maketh drunk
like wine, so that the natives do drink it for wine; and those
who wish not to drink it so, boil it down to one-third of its
bulk, and then it becometh thick, like honey; and ’tis sweet,
and fit for making preserves, like honey and the honeycomb.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
One branch gives one potful in the day and one in the night,
on the average throughout the year:<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> thus five or six pots
may be found hung upon the same tree at once. With the
leaves of this tree they cover their houses during the rainy
season.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> The fruit is that which we call <i>nuts of India</i>; and
from the rind of that fruit is made the twine with which they
stitch their boats together in those parts.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>11. There is another tree of a different species, which like
that gives all the year round a white liquor pleasant to drink,
which tree is called <i>Tárí</i>.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> There is also another, called <i>Belluri</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
giving a liquor of the same kind, but better.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> There be
also many other trees, and wonderful ones; among which is
one which sendeth forth roots from high up, which gradually
grow down to the ground and enter it, and then wax into
trunks like the main trunk, forming as it were an arch; and
by this kind of multiplication one tree will have at once as
many as twenty or thirty trunks beside one another, and all
connected together. ’Tis marvellous! And truly this which
I have seen with mine eyes, ’tis hard to utter with my tongue.
The fruit of this tree is not useful, but poisonous and deadly.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
There is [also] a tree harder than all, which the strongest
arrows can scarcely pierce.</p>

<p>12. The trees in this India, and also in India the Greater,
never shed their leaves till the new ones come.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>13. To write about the other trees would be too long a
business, and tedious beyond measure; seeing that they are
many and divers, and beyond the comprehension of man.</p>

<p>14. But about wild beasts of the forest I say this: there
be lions, leopards, ounces, and another kind something like
a greyhound, having only the ears black and the whole
body perfectly white, which among those people is called
<i>Siagois</i>.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> This animal, whatever it catches, never lets go,
even to death. There is also another animal, which is called
<i>Rhinoceros</i>,<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> as big as a horse, having one horn long and
twisted; but it is not the <i>unicorn</i>.</p>

<p>15. There be also venomous animals, such as many serpents,
big beyond bounds, and of divers colours, black, red,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
white, and green, and parti-coloured; two-headed also, three-headed,
and five-headed. Admirable marvels!<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>16. There be also coquodriles, which are vulgarly called
<i>Calcatix</i>;<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> some of them be so big that they be bigger than
the biggest horse. These animals be like lizards, and have
a tail stretched over all, like unto a lizard’s; and have a
head like unto a swine’s, and rows of teeth so powerful and
horrible that no animal can escape their force, particularly
in the water. This animal has, as it were, a coat of mail;
and there is no sword, nor lance, nor arrow, which can anyhow
hurt him, on account of the hardness of his scales. In
the water, in short, there is nothing so strong, nothing so
evil, as this wonderful animal. There be also many other
reptiles, whose names, to speak plainly, I know not.</p>

<p>17. As for birds, I say plainly that they are of quite different
kinds from what are found on this side of the world;
except, indeed, crows and sparrows;<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> for there be parrots
and popinjays in very great numbers, so that a thousand or
more may be seen in a flock. These birds, when tamed and
kept in cages, speak so that you would take them for rational
beings. There be also bats really and truly as big as kites.
These birds fly nowhither by day, but only when the sun
sets. Wonderful! By day they hang themselves up on
trees by the feet, with their bodies downwards, and in the
daytime they look just like big fruit on the tree.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<p>18. There are also other birds, such as peacocks, quails,
Indian fowls,<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> and others, divers in kind; some white as
white can be, some green as green can be, some parti-coloured,
of such beauty as is past telling.</p>

<p>19. In this India, when men go to the wars, and when
they act as guards to their lords, they go naked, with a
round target,—a frail and paltry affair,—and holding a kind
of a spit<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> in their hands; and, truly, their fighting seems
like child’s play.</p>

<p>20. In this India are many and divers precious stones,
among which are the best diamonds under heaven. These
stones never can be dressed or shaped by any art, except
what nature has given. But I omit the properties of these
stones, not to be prolix.</p>

<p>21. In this India are many other precious stones, endowed
with excellent virtues, which may be gathered by
anybody; nor is anyone hindered.</p>

<p>22. In this India, on the death of a noble, or of any
people of substance, their bodies are burned: and eke their
wives follow them alive to the fire, and, for the sake of
worldly glory, and for the love of their husbands, and for
eternal life, burn along with them, with as much joy as if
they were going to be wedded; and those who do this have
the higher repute for virtue and perfection among the rest.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
Wonderful! I have sometimes seen, for one dead man who
was burnt, five living women take their places on the fire
with him, and die with their dead.</p>

<p>23. There be also other pagan-folk in this India who
worship fire; they bury not their dead, neither do they
burn them, but cast them into the midst of a certain roofless
tower, and there expose them totally uncovered to the fowls
of heaven. These believe in two First Principles, to wit, of
Evil and of Good, of Darkness and of Light, matters which
at present I do not purpose to discuss.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>24. There be also certain others which be called <i>Dumbri</i>,
who eat carrion and carcases; who have absolutely no object
of worship; and who have to do the drudgeries of other
people, and carry loads.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>25. In this India there is green ginger, and it grows
there in great abundance.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>There be also sugar-canes in quantities; carobs also, of
such size and bigness that it is something stupendous.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> I
could tell very wonderful things of this India; but I am not
able to detail them for lack of time. Cassia fistula is in
some parts of this India extremely abundant.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span></p>

<p>26. The people of this India are very clean in their feeding;
true in speech, and eminent in justice, maintaining
carefully the privileges of every man according to his degree,
as they have come down from old times.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>27. The heat there is perfectly horrible, and more intolerable
to strangers than it is possible to say.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span></p>

<p>28. In this India there exists not, nor is found, any metal
but what comes from abroad, except gold, iron, and electrum.
There is no pepper there, nor any kind of spice except
ginger.</p>

<p>29. In this India the greater part of the people worship
idols, although a great share of the sovereignty is in the
hands of the Turkish Saracens, who came forth from Multán,
and conquered and usurped dominion to themselves not long
since, and destroyed an infinity of idol temples, and likewise
many churches, of which they made mosques for
Mahomet, taking possession of their endowments and property.
’Tis grief to hear, and woe to see!<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>30. The Pagans of this India have prophecies of their
own that we Latins are to subjugate the whole world.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>31. In this India there is a scattered people, one here,
another there, who call themselves Christians, but are not
so, nor have they baptism, nor do they know anything else
about the faith. Nay, they believe St. Thomas the Great
to be Christ!</p>

<p>32. There, in the India I speak of, I baptized and brought
into the faith about three hundred souls, of whom many
were idolaters and Saracens.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span></p>

<p>33. And let me tell you that among the idolaters a man
may with safety expound the Word of the Lord; nor is anyone
from among the idolaters hindered from being baptized
throughout all the East, whether they be Tartars, or Indians,
or what not.</p>

<p>34. These idolaters sacrifice to their gods in this manner;
to wit, there is one man who is priest to the idol, and he
wears a long shirt, down to the ground almost, and above
this a white surplice<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> in our fashion; and he has a clerk
with a shirt who goes after him, and carries a hassock,
which he sets before the priest. And upon this the priest
kneels, and so begins to advance from a distance, like one
performing his stations; and he carries upon his bent arms
a tray of two cubits [long], all full of eatables of different
sorts, with lighted tapers at top; and thus praying he comes
up to the altar where the idol is, and deposits the offering
before it after their manner; and he pours a libation, and
places part [of the offering] in the hands of the idol, and
then divides the residue, and himself eats a part of it.</p>

<p>35. They make idols after the likeness of almost all living
things of the idolaters; and they have besides their god
according to his likeness.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> It is true that over all gods they
place One God, the Almighty Creator of all those.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> They<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
hold also that the world has existed now xxviii thousand
years.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>The Indians, both of this India and of the other Indies,
never kill an ox, but rather honour him like a father; and
some, even perhaps the majority, worship him. They will
more readily spare him who has slain five men than him
who has slain one ox, saying that it is no more lawful to
kill an ox than to kill one’s father. This is because oxen do
all their services, and moreover furnish them with milk and
butter, and all sorts of good things.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> The great lords
among the idolaters, every morning when they rise, and
before they go anywhither, make the fattest cows come
before them, and lay their hands upon them, and then rub
their own faces, believing that after this they can have no
ailment.</p>

<p>36. Let this be enough about Lesser India; for were I
to set forth particulars of everything down to worms and
the like, a year would not suffice for the description.</p>

<p>37. But [I may say in conclusion] as for the women and
men, the blacker they be, the more beautiful they be
[held.]<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="V">V.<br />
<span class="smaller">HERE FOLLOWETH CONCERNING INDIA THE GREATER.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>1. Of India the Greater I say this; that it is like unto
Lesser India as regards all the folk being black. The
animals also are all similar, neither more nor less [in number],
except elephants, which they have [in the former] in
very great plenty. These animals are marvellous; for they
exceed in size and bulk and strength, and also in understanding,
all the animals of the world. This animal hath a
big head; small eyes, smaller than a horse’s; ears like the
wings of owls or bats; a nose reaching quite to the ground,
extending right down from the top of his head; and two
tusks standing out of remarkable magnitude [both in] bulk
and length, which are [in fact] teeth rooted in the upper
jaw. This animal doth everything by word of command;
so that his driver hath nothing to do but say once, “Do this,”
and he doeth it; nor doth he seem in other respects a brute,
but rather a rational creature. They have very big feet,
with six hoofs like those of an ox, or rather of a camel.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>
This animal carrieth easily upon him, with a certain structure
of timber, more than thirty men; and he is a most
gentle beast,<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> and trained for war, so that a single animal
counteth by himself equal in war to 1,500 men and more;
for they bind to his tusks blades or maces of iron wherewith
he smiteth. Most horrible are the powers of this beast, and
specially in war.</p>

<p>2. Two things there be which cannot be withstood by
arms: one is the bolt of heaven; the second is a stone from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
an artillery engine; this is a third! For there is nothing
that either can or dare stand against the assault of an elephant
in any manner. A marvellous thing! He kneeleth,
lieth, sitteth, goeth and cometh, merely at his master’s
word. In short, it is impossible to write in words the peculiarities
of this animal.</p>

<p>3. In this India there are pepper and ginger, cinnamon,
brazil,<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> and all other spices.</p>

<p>4. Ginger is the root of a plant which hath leaves like a
reed. Pepper is the fruit of a plant something like ivy,
which climbs trees, and forms grape-like fruit like that of
the wild vine.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> This fruit is at first green, then when it
comes to maturity it becomes all black and corrugated as
you see it. ’Tis thus that long pepper is produced, nor are
you to believe that fire is placed under the pepper, nor that
it is roasted, as some will lyingly maintain.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> Cinnamon is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
the bark of a large tree which has fruit and flowers like
cloves.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>5. In this India be many islands, and more than 10,000
of them inhabited, as I have heard; wherein are many world’s
wonders.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> For there is one called Silem, where are found
the best precious stones in the whole world, and in the
greatest quantity and number, and of all kinds.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>6. Between that island and the main are taken pearls or
marguerites, in such quantity as to be quite wonderful. So
indeed that there are sometimes more than 8,000 boats or
vessels, for three months continuously, [engaged in this
fishery]. It is astounding, and almost incredible, to those
who have not seen it, how many are taken.</p>

<p>7. Of birds I say this: that there be many different from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
those of Lesser India, and of different colours; for there be
some white all over as snow; some red as scarlet of the
grain; some green as grass; some parti-coloured; in such
quantity and delectability as cannot be uttered. Parrots
also, or popinjays, after their kind, of every possible colour
except black, for black ones are never found; but white all
over, and green, and red, and also of mixed colours. The
birds of this India seem really like creatures of Paradise.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>8. There is also told a marvellous thing of the islands
aforesaid, to wit that there is one of them in which there is
a water, and a certain tree in the middle of it. Every metal
which is washed with that water becomes gold; every wound
on which are placed the bruised leaves of that tree is incontinently
healed.</p>

<p>9. In this India, whilst I was at Columbum, were found
two cats having wings like the wings of bats;<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> and in Lesser
India there be some rats as big as foxes, and venomous exceedingly.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>10. In this India are certain trees which have leaves so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
big that five or six men can very well stand under the shade
of one of them.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>11. In the aforesaid island of Sylen is a very potent king,
who hath precious stones of every kind under heaven, in
such quantity as to be almost incredible. Among these he
hath two rubies, of which he weareth one hung round his
neck, and the other on the hand wherewith he wipeth his
lips and his beard; and [each] is of greater length than the
breadth of four fingers, and when held in the hand it standeth
out visibly on either side to the breadth of a finger. I do not
believe that the universal world hath two stones like these,
or of so great a price, of the same species.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>12. There is also another island where all the men and
women go absolutely naked, and have in place of money
comminuted gold like fine sand. They make of the cloth
which they buy walls like curtains;<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> nor do they cover themselves
or their shame at any time in the world.</p>

<p>13. There is also another exceeding great island, which
is called Jaua,<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> which is in circuit more than seven [thousand?]
miles as I have heard,<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> and where are many world’s
wonders. Among which, besides the finest aromatic spices,
this is one, to wit, that there be found pygmy men, of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
size of a boy of three or four years old, all shaggy like a
he goat. They dwell in the woods, and few are found.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<p>14. In this island also are white mice, exceeding beautiful.
There also are trees producing cloves, which, when
they are in flower, emit an odour so pungent that they kill
every man who cometh among them, unless he shut his
mouth and nostrils.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>15. There too are produced cubebs, and nutmegs, and
mace, and all the other finest spices except pepper.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>16. In a certain part of that island they delight to eat
white and fat men when they can get them.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>17. In the Greater India, and in the islands, all the people<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
be black, and go naked from the loins upwards, and from
the knee downwards, and without shoes.</p>

<p>18. But the kings have this distinction from others, that
they wear upon their arms gold and silver rings, and on the
neck a gold collar with a great abundance of gems.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>19. In this India never do [even] the legitimate sons of
great kings, or princes, or barons, inherit the goods of their
parents, but only the sons of their sisters; for they say that
they have no surety that those are their own sons, because
wives and mistresses may conceive and generate by some
one else; but ’tis not so with the sister, for whatever man
may be the father they are certain that the offspring is from
the womb of their sister, and is consequently thus truly of
their blood.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>20. In this Greater India many sacrifice themselves to
idols in this way. When they are sick, or involved in any
grave mischance, they vow themselves to the idol if they
should happen to be delivered. Then, when they have recovered,
they fatten themselves for one or two years continually,
eating and drinking fat things, etc. And when another<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
festival comes round, they cover themselves with flowers
and perfumes, and crown themselves with white garlands,
and go with singing and playing before the idol when it is
carried through the land (like the image of the Virgin Mary
here among us at the Rogation tides); and those men who
are sacrificing themselves to the idol carry a sword with two
handles, like those [knives] which are used in currying leather;
and, after they have shown off a great deal, they put
the sword to the back of the neck, cutting strongly with a
vigorous exertion of both hands, and so cut off their own
heads before the idol.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span></p>

<p>21. In this Greater India, in the place where I was, the
nights and days are almost equal, nor does one exceed the
other in length at any season by so much as a full hour.</p>

<p>22. In this India the sun keeps to the south for six
months continuously, casting the shadows to the north; and
for the other six months keeps to the north, casting the
shadow to the south.<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>23. In this India the Pole-star is seen very low, insomuch
that I was at one place where it did not show above the
earth or the sea more than two fingers’ breadth.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>24. There the nights, when the weather is fine and there
is no moon, are, if I err not, four times as clear as in our
part of the world.</p>

<p>25. There also, if I err not, between evening and morning,
often all the planets may be seen; there are seen their
influences [as it were] eye to eye, so that ’tis a delightful
thing there to look out at night!<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>26. From the place aforesaid is seen continually between
the south and the east a star of great size and ruddy splendour,
which is called Canopus, and which from these parts
of the world is never visible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span></p>

<p>27. There are many marvellous things in the cycle of
those [heavenly bodies] to delight a good astronomer.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>28. In this India, and in India the Less, men who dwell
a long way from the sea, under the ground and in woody
tracts, seem altogether infernal; neither eating, drinking,
nor clothing themselves like the others who dwell by the
sea.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>29. There serpents too be numerous, and very big, of all
colours in the world; and it is a great marvel that they be
seldom or never found to hurt anybody unless first attacked.</p>

<p>30. There is there also a certain kind of wasps, which
make it their business to kill very big spiders whenever they
find them, and afterwards to bury them in the sand, in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
deep hole which they make, and so to cover them up that
there is no man in the world who can turn them up, or find
the place.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p>31. There is also a kind of very small ants, white as wool,
which have such hard teeth that they gnaw through even
timbers and the joints of stones,<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> and, in short, whatever dry
thing they find on the face of the earth, and mutilate woollen
and cotton clothes. And they build out of the finest sand a
crust like a wall, so that the sun cannot reach them, and so
they remain covered. But if that crust happens to get
broken, so that the sun reaches them, they incontinently
die.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>32. As regards insects, there be wonders, so many, great,
and marvellous, that they cannot be told.</p>

<p>33. There is also in this India a certain bird, big like a
kite, having a white head and belly, but all red above, which
boldly snatches fish out of the hands of fishermen and other
people, and indeed [these birds] go on just like dogs.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span></p>

<p>34. There is also another big bird, not like a kite, which
flies only at night, and utters a voice in the night season like
the voice of a man wailing from the deep.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>35. What shall I say then? Even the Devil too there
speaketh to men, many a time and oft, in the night season,
as I have heard.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>36. Every thing indeed is a marvel in this India! Verily
it is quite another world!</p>

<p>37. There is also a certain part of that India which is
called Champa. There, in place of horses, mules and asses,
and camels, they make use of elephants for all their work.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span></p>

<p>38. ’Tis a wonderful thing about these animals, that when
they are in a wild state they challenge each other to war,
and form troops [for the purpose]; so that there will be
sometimes a hundred against a hundred, more or less; and
they put the strongest and biggest and boldest at the head,
and thus attack each other in turn, so that within a short time
there will remain in one place XL or L killed and wounded,
more or less. And ’tis a notable thing that the vanquished,
it is said, never again appear in war or in the field.</p>

<p>39. These animals, on account of their ivory, are worth as
much dead as alive, nor are they ever taken when little, but
only when big and full grown.</p>

<p>40. And the mode of taking them is wonderful. Enclosures
are made, very strong, and of four sides, wherein
be many gateways, and raised gates, formed of very big and
strong timbers. And there is one trained female elephant
which is taken near the place where the elephants come to
feed. The one which they desire to catch is pointed out to
her, and she is told to manage so as to bring him home. She
goeth about him and about him, and so contriveth by stroking
him and licking him, as to induce him to follow her, and to
enter along with her the outer gate, which the keepers
incontinently let fall. Then, when the wild elephant
turneth about, the female entereth the second gate, which is
instantly shut like the first, and so the [wild] elephant remaineth
caught between the two gates. Then cometh a man,
clothed in black or red, with his face covered, who cruelly
thrasheth him from above, and crieth out abusively against
him as against a thief; and this goeth on for five or six days,
without his getting anything to eat or drink. Then cometh<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
another fellow, with his face bare, and clad in another
colour, who feigneth to smite the first man, and to drive and
thrust him away; then he cometh to the elephant and
talketh to him, and with a long spear he scratcheth him, and
he kisseth him, and giveth him food; and this goeth on for ten
or fifteen days, and so by degrees he ventureth down beside
him, and bindeth him to another elephant. And thus, after
about twenty days, he may be taken out to be taught and
broken in.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>41. In this Greater India are twelve idolatrous kings, and
more.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> For there is one very powerful king in the country<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
where pepper grows, and his kingdom is called Molebar.
There is also the king of Singuyli and the king of Columbum,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
the king of which is called Lingua, but his kingdom Mohebar.
There is also the king of Molephatam, whose kingdom is
called Molepoor, where pearls are taken in infinite quantities.
There is also another king in the island of Sylen, where are
found precious stones and good elephants. There be also
three or four kings on the island of Java, where the good
spices grow. There be also other kings, as the king of
Telenc, who is very potent and great. The kingdom of
Telenc abounds in corn, rice, sugar, wax, honey and honeycomb,
pulse, eggs, goats, buffalos, beeves, milk, butter, and
in oils of divers kinds, and in many excellent fruits, more
than any other part of the Indies. There is also the kingdom
of Maratha which is very great; and there is the king
of Batigala, but he is of the Saracens. There be also many
kings in Chopa.</p>

<p>42. What shall I say? The greatness of this India is
beyond description. But let this much suffice concerning
India the Greater and the Less.</p>

<span class="smaller">HERE FOLLOWETH CONCERNING INDIA TERTIA.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></span></h2>

</div>

<p>1. Of India Tertia I will say this, that I have not indeed
seen its many marvels, not having been there, but have
heard them from trustworthy persons. For example, there
be dragons in the greatest abundance, which carry on their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
heads the lustrous stones which be called carbuncles. These
animals have their lying-place upon golden sands,<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> and grow
exceeding big, and cast forth from the mouth a most fetid
and infectious breath, like the thickest smoke rising from fire.
These animals come together at the destined time, develope
wings, and begin to raise themselves in the air, and then,
by the judgment of God, being too heavy, they drop into a
certain river which issues from Paradise, and perish there.</p>

<p>2. But all the regions round about watch for the time of
the dragons, and when they see that one has fallen, they
wait for lxx days, and then go down and find the bare bones
of the dragon, and take the carbuncle which is rooted in the
top of his head, and carry it to the emperor of the Æthiopians,
whom you call Prestre Johan.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

<p>3. In this India Tertia are certain birds, which are called
Roc, so big that they easily carry an elephant up into the
air. I have seen a certain person who said that he had seen
one of those birds, one wing only of which stretched to a
length of eighty palms.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>4. In this India are the true unicorns, like a great horse,
having only one horn in the forehead, very thick and sharp,
but short, and quite solid, marrow and all.<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> This creature,<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
it is said, is of such fierceness that it will kill an elephant,
nor can it be captured except by a virgin girl. All the
parts of that creature are of wonderful virtue, and the whole
of them good for medicine.</p>

<p>5. There are other animals also of very divers species:
thus, there is one like a cat, whose sweat is of such good
odour that it surpasses all the other scents in the world, and
that sweat is thus collected. When it sweats it rubs itself
on a certain wood, and there [the sweat] becomes coagulated;
then men come and collect it, and carry it away.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p>6. Between this India and Æthiopia is said to be, towards
the east, the terrestrial paradise; for from those parts come
down the four rivers of Paradise, which abound exceedingly
in gold and gems.</p>

<p>7. There be serpents with horns, and some with precious
stones.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>8. The men of that land are very black, pot-bellied,
fat, but short; having thick lips and squab nose, overhanging
forehead, and hideous countenances, whilst they go
altogether naked.</p>

<p>9. I have seen many of them. They hunt the most savage
beasts, such as lions, ounces, and leopards, and most dreadful
serpents; wild men they be, wild against wild beasts!</p>

<p>10. In this India is found embar, which is like wood,
and exceeding fragrant, and is called <i>gemma marina</i>, or the
Treasure of the Sea.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>

<p>11. There also be certain animals like an ass, but with
transverse stripes of black and white, such as that one stripe
is black and the next white. These animals be wonderfully
beautiful.</p>

<p>12. Between this India and India the Greater, are said to
be islands of women only, and of men only, such that the
men cannot live long in the islands of the women, and <i>vice
versa</i>.</p>

<p>13. But they can live there for some x or xv days and
cohabit; and when the women produce male children they
send them to the men, and when female children they retain
them.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>14. There are many other different islands in which are
men having the heads of dogs, but their women are said to
be beautiful.<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> I cease not to marvel at the great variety of
islands that there be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>

<p>15. Let this suffice about India Tertia and the islands for
the present.</p>

<span class="smaller">HERE FOLLOWETH CONCERNING THE GREATER ARABIA.</span></h2>

</div>

<p>1. I have been in the Greater Arabia, but can tell little,
except that there grow there choice incense and myrrh.</p>

<p>2. The natives of this Arabia are all black, very crafty
and lean, with voices like that of a little boy. They dwell
in caverns and holes on the ground: they eat fish, herbs,
and roots, and nothing else.<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>3. This Arabia hath very great deserts, pathless and
very dry.</p>

<p>4. Of Æthiopia, I say that it is a very great land, and a
very hot. There are many monsters there, such as gryphons
that guard the golden mountains which be there. Here, too,
be serpents and other venomous beasts, of vast size and
venomous exceedingly.</p>

<p>5. There, too, are very many pretious stones. The lord
of that land I believe to be more potent than any man in
the world, and richer in gold and silver and in pretious
stones. He is said to have under him fifty-two kings, rich
and potent. He ruleth over all his neighbours towards the
south and the west.</p>

<p>6. In this Æthiopia are two burning mountains, and between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
them a mountain of gold. The people of the country
are all Christians, but heretics. I have seen and known
many folk from those parts.</p>

<p>7. To that emperor the Soldan of Babylon giveth every
year 500,000 ducats<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> of tribute as ’tis said.</p>

<p>8. I can tell nothing more of Æthiopia, not having been
there.</p>

<span class="smaller">HERE FOLLOWETH CONCERNING THE GREAT TARTAR.<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></span></h2>

</div>

<p>1. Of the Great Tartar, I relate what I have heard from
trustworthy persons; to wit, that he is very rich, very just,
and very generous. He hath under him four realms as big
as the realm of France, and well peopled too. In his dominions
every person who cannot get a livelihood, may, an he
will, have victual and raiment from that lord, all the days
of his life.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>2. In his dominion is current, in place of money, paper
stamped with black ink, with which can be procured gold,
silver, silk, gems, and in short all that man can desire.<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>3. In that empire are idol-temples, and also monasteries
of men and women as with us; and they have a choral
service and sermons just like us; and the great pontiffs of
the idols wear red hats and capes like our cardinals. ’Tis
incredible what splendour, what pomp, what festivity is
made in the idol sacrifices.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span></p>

<p>4. There they burn not their dead; nor do they bury
them sometimes for ten years. Some defer this because they
have not the means to perform the sacrifices and the obsequies
as they would wish. But they keep the body in the
house, and serve it with food as if it were alive.</p>

<p>5. The great lords, when they die, are buried with a horse,
and with one or two of their best beloved slaves alive.<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>6. In that empire are very great cities, as I have heard
tell from those who have seen them; and there is one called
Hyemo which it taketh a day’s journey on horseback to
cross, by a direct street through the middle of it.<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>

<p>7. I have heard that that emperor hath two hundred
cities under him greater than Toulouse; and I certainly
believe them to have more inhabitants.</p>

<p>8. The folk of that empire be marvellously well-mannered,
clean, courteous, and liberal withal.</p>

<p>9. In that empire rhubarb is found, and musk. And<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
musk is the navel of a certain wild animal like a goat, from
which, when it is taken alive, the skin of the navel is cut in
a round form, and the blood which flows from the wound is
gathered and put into the said skin, and dried; and that
makes the best musk in the world.</p>

<p>10. There are no other things in that empire that I am
acquainted with worthy to be described, except the very
beautiful and noble earthenware, full of good qualities, and
[which is called] porcelain.<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>11. When the emperor dies, he is carried by certain men
with a very great treasure to a certain place, where they
place the body, and run away as if the devil were after
them, and others are ready incontinently to snatch up the
body and bear it in like manner to another place, and so on
to the place of burial; and they thus do that the place may
not be found, and consequently that no one may be able to
steal the treasure.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p>

<p>12. Nor is the death of the emperor made known until
another has been secretly established on the throne by his
relations and the chiefs.<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a></p>

<p>13. That emperor bestows greater alms than any prince
or lord in the world.</p>

<p>14. The people subject to him are for the most part
idolaters.</p>

<p>1. Of Caldea I will say not much, but yet what is greatly
to be wondered at; to wit, that in a place of that country
stood Babylon, now destroyed and deserted, where are
hairy serpents and monstrous animals. In the same place
also, in the night season, are heard such shoutings, such
howlings, such hissings, that it is called Hell. There no
one would dare to pass a single night, even with a great
army, on account of the endless terrors and spectres.<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<p>2. When I was there, there was seen a tortoise that
carried five men on its back.<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p>3. Also a two-headed animal, exceeding frightful, which
dared to wade across the Euphrates, and to chase the inhabitants
on the other side.<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>4. Also there be there serpents of such bulk that it is
horrible to hear tell of; and I believe that that land is the
habitation of demons.</p>

Moorish Sea. And that empire<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> extendeth far; for it includeth
Lesser Asia, Cilicia,<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> Media, Cappadocia, Lycia,
Greater Armenia, Caldea, Georgiana, part of the Caspian
Hills and Mogan,—whence came those three kings to
worship Christ,<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>—even to the Iron Gates,<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> and all Persia,
with some part of Lesser India; so that the empire extendeth
across from the Black Sea to the Indian Sea, and so
great is the distance as to equal lxxxx days of ordinary
journey with cattle, or more.</p>

<p>4. Then Lesser India extendeth four-square over LX
days’ journey, and is entirely level.</p>

<p>5. But the Greater India extendeth over more than
CLXX days’ journey, excluding the islands, of which there
be more than XII thousand inhabited, and more than VIII
thousand uninhabited, as those say who navigate that sea.
And [this India also] is nearly all a plain.</p>

<p>6. But the vessels of these Indies be of a marvellous kind.
For although they be very great, they be not put together<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
with iron, but stitched with a needle, and a thread made of
a kind of grass. Nor are the vessels ever decked over, but
open, and they take in water to such an extent that the men
always, or almost always, must stand in a pool to bale out
the water.</p>

<p>7. Cathay is a very great empire, which extendeth over
more than C days’ journey; and it hath only one lord,
whereas the case with the Indies is the very opposite, for
there be therein many kings, many princes, not one of
whom holdeth himself tributary to another.</p>

<p>8. And the dominion of Æthiopia is great exceedingly;
and I believe, and lie not, that the population thereof is, at
the least, three times that of our Christendom.<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>

<p>9. But other two empires of the Tartars, as I have heard,
to wit, that which was formerly of Cathay, but now is of
Osbet, which is called Gatzaria, and the empire of Dua and
Cayda, formerly of Capac and now of Elchigaday, extend
over more than CC days’ journey.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p>10. The vessels which they navigate in Cathay be very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
big, and have upon the ship’s hull more than C cabins, and
with a fair wind they carry X sails, and they are very bulky,
being made of three thicknesses of plank, so that the first
thickness is as in our great ships, the second cross-wise, the
third again long-wise. In sooth, ’tis a very strong affair.<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> It
is true that they venture not far out to sea; and that Indian
sea is seldom or never boisterous, and when it does rise to
such a degree as they deem awfully perilous, it is such
weather as our mariners here would deem splendid. For
one of the men of our country would there (’tis no lie), be
reckoned at sea worth a hundred of theirs and more.</p>

<p>11. Græcia<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> also is of great extent, but of how many days’
journey I wot not.</p>

<p>12. One general remark I will make in conclusion; to wit,
that there is no better land or fairer, no people so honest, no
victuals so good and savoury, dress so handsome, or manners
so noble, as here in our own Christendom; and, above all,
we have the true faith, though ill it be kept. For, as God is
my witness, ten times better [Christians], and more charitable
withal, be those who be converted by the Preaching and
Minor friars to our faith, than our own folk here, as experience
hath taught me.</p>

<p>13. And of the conversion of those nations of India, I say
this: that if there were two hundred or three hundred good
friars, who would faithfully and fervently preach the Catholic
faith, there is not a year which would not see more than X
thousand persons converted to the Christian faith.</p>

<p>14. For, whilst I was among those schismatics and unbelievers,
I believe that more than X thousand, or thereabouts,
were converted to our faith, and because we, being few in
number, could not occupy, or even visit, many parts of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
land, many souls (wo is me!) have perished, and exceeding
many do yet perish for lack of preachers of the Word of the
Lord. And ’tis grief and pain to hear how, through the
preachers of the perfidious and accursed Saracens, those sects
of the heathen be day by day perverted. For their preachers
run about, just as we do, here, there, and everywhere over
the whole Orient, in order to turn all to their own miscreance.<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>
These be they who accuse us, who smite us, who
cause us to be cast into durance, and who stone us; as I indeed
have experienced, having been four times cast into
prison by them, I mean the Saracens. But how many times
I have had my hair plucked out, and been scourged, and
been stoned, God himself knoweth and I, who had to bear
all this for my sins, and yet have not attained to end my life
as a martyr for the faith, as did four of my brethren. For
what remaineth God’s will be done! Nay, five Preaching
Friars and four Minors were there in my time cruelly slain
for the Catholic faith.</p>

<p>Wo is me that I was not with them there!</p>

<p>15. I believe moreover that the king of France might
subdue the whole world to his own dominion and to the
Christian faith, without the aid of any other.</p>

the gum of a very noble tree. That island was held by a

Cathani, who hath with him only fifty-two knights<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> and four

nor do I believe that the art could have been invented by
human ingenuity, but rather by the Holy Spirit.<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> For thus
it is: stones be taken from under the ground, not stones of
any kind, but such as be specially suitable, for few be found
of that kind. And these stones be baked like bricks or
pottery, and that in great quantity and for many days, and
with a most potent fire. The stones be afterwards placed on
a great platform, and water is poured upon them, and this
two or three times a day for a month continuously, so that the
stones become like [slaked] lime. Afterwards they be placed
in great caldrons with water, and that which falleth to the
bottom is extracted with great iron ladles. Then four-square
tanks of plaster are prepared, numerous and large, and into
these the water from the caldrons is poured, and there
gradually taketh place a precipitation like crystal, and that
is choice alum.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p><a id="Footnote_41" href="#FNanchor_41" class="label">[41]</a> Admiral Smyth says that the currents in the Faro are so numerous
and varied, that it is difficult to ascertain anything precise about them.
In settled seasons a central stream runs north and south, at the rate of
two to five miles an hour. On each shore there is a <i>refluo</i>, or counter-set,
often forming eddies to the central current. When the main current runs
to the north it is called <i>Rema montante</i>, or flood; when it runs south, <i>Rema
scendente</i>, or ebb; and this has obtained, perhaps, even from the days of
Eratosthenes. He considers that the <i>special</i> danger from the Faro currents
is insignificant. There are dangerous <i>squalls</i> from the ravines or river-beds
on the high Calabrian coast.</p>

<p>He admits some little more of reality in the celebrated vortex of
Charybdis, which must have been formidable to the undecked vessels of
the ancients; for in the present day small craft are sometimes endangered,
and he has seen even a seventy-four whirled round on its surface. The “Galofaro”
appears to be an agitated water of from seventy to ninety fathoms
in depth, circling in quick eddies, but rather an incessant undulation
than a whirlpool, and the cases are only extreme when any vortiginous
ripples threaten danger to laden boats. “It is owing probably to the
meeting of the harbour and lateral currents with the main one, the latter
being forced over in this direction by the opposite point of Pezzo. This
agrees in some measure with the relation of Thucydides, who calls it a
violent reciprocation of the Tyrrhene and Sicilian seas, and he is the only
writer of remote antiquity I remember to have read who has assigned this
danger its true situation, and not exaggerated its effects.” (<i>Abridged from</i>
Smyth’s <i>Mediterranean</i>, pp. 180-1). Our author seems to mix up the two
phenomena in his exaggerated account. The <i>upward and downward current</i>
suggest that he had heard the local terms quoted by Admiral Smyth.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_42" href="#FNanchor_42" class="label">[42]</a> “The breadth of the Euripus is diminished by a rock in mid-channel,
on which a fort is built, dividing it into two channels: that towards the
main, though rather the broader, is only practicable for small boats, as
there is not more than three feet water at any time. Between the rock
and the walls of Egripos is a distance of 33 feet, and the least depth at
the highest water is 7 feet. It is here that the extraordinary tides take
place for which the Euripus was formerly so noted; at times the water
runs as much as eight miles an hour, with a fall under the bridge of 1½
foot; but what is most singular is, that vessels lying 150 yards from the
bridge are not the least affected by this rapid. It remains but a short
time in a quiescent state, changing its direction in a few minutes, and
almost immediately resuming its velocity, which is generally from four to
five miles an hour either way, its greatest rapidity being, however, always
to the southward. The results of three months’ observation, in which
the above phenomena were noted, afforded no sufficient data for reducing
them to any regularity.”—<i>Penny Cyclop.</i>, Article <i>Eubœa</i>. See also <i>Leake</i>

<p><a id="Footnote_44" href="#FNanchor_44" class="label">[44]</a> The first ascent of Ararat is well known to have been made by Professor
Parrot, of Dorpat, 9th October, 1829, whose account of his journey has
been translated by Mr. Cooley.</p>

<p>“From the summit downwards, for nearly two-thirds of a mile perpendicular,
or nearly three miles in an oblique direction, it is covered with a
crown of eternal snow and ice” (<i>Parrot’s Journey</i>, p. 133). As to the
clouds, the same author remarks with regard to a drawing of Ararat:
“The belt of clouds about the mountain is characteristic” (p. 137). And
Smith and Dwight (<i>Researches in Armenia</i>, p. 266) say that they were prevented
by clouds from seeing it for three weeks. It is believed in the
country that the Ark still exists on the mountain, access to which has
been forbidden by Divine decree since Noah’s time. A holy monk called
Jacob resolved to convince himself by inspection. But in his ascent of
the mountain he three times was overtaken by sleep, and each time found
that he had unconsciously lost the ground that he had gained when awake.
At last an angel came to him when again asleep, and told him that his
zeal was fruitless, but was to be rewarded by a fragment of the wood of
the Ark, a sacred relic still preserved in the Cathedral of Echmiazin.
(<i>Parrot</i>, and <i>Smith and Dwight</i>); see also the narrative of <i>Guillaume de
Rubruk</i> (Rubruquis), in <i>Rec. de Voyages</i>, iv. p. 387.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_45" href="#FNanchor_45" class="label">[45]</a> Stories of serpents seem to be rife in Armenia. On the Araxes, south
of Nakhcheván (see note below), is a mountain called the Serpent Mountain,
where serpents are said to collect in such numbers at certain times,
that no man or beast dare approach. (See <i>Haxthausen’s Transcaucasia</i>,
pp. 144, 181, 353, etc.)</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_46" href="#FNanchor_46" class="label">[46]</a> The name of the province and town of Nakhcheván, east of Ararat,
signifies “first place of descent, or of lodging.” The antiquity of the tradition
is proved by the fact, that Josephus affirms that the Armenians
call the place where the Ark rested “<i>the place of descent</i>;” whilst Ptolemy
supplies the name of Naxuana. (<i>Smith and Dwight</i>, p. 255.)</p>

<p>The place alluded to by Jordanus appears to be Arguri, the only village
upon Ararat. Here Noah is said to have built his altar on the exact spot
now occupied by the church, and it is of the vineyards of Arguri that the
Scripture is believed to speak when it is said that “Noah began to be an
husbandman, and planted a vineyard.” The church is of unascertained
but remote date; and the name of the place signifies (<i>Argh-urri</i>) “He
planted the vine.” (<i>Parrot</i>, p. 122.) At Nakhcheván “the grapes were
almost unequalled in excellence, and seemed to deserve the honour of
growing on the spot.” (<i>Smith and Dwight</i>, p. 256.) Arguri was buried
by an earthquake, accompanied by volcanic indications, July 2nd, 1840.

the Lord, to Abgarus of Edessa, who had written the celebrated letter.
Thaddeus, and Bartholomew who followed him, were successively put to
death by Sanatruk, the heathen nephew of Abgarus. Jude also came to
preach in Armenia, and was put to death in Ormi (Urumia). The mission
of Simon I do not find mentioned, but Chardin states that his body was
said to be preserved in one of the churches. (See <i>Avdall’s</i> Tr. of <i>Chamich’s

eastward is said to have been arrested by the venomous serpents with
which the long grass of the plain is infested. The dread of these
serpents still exists. “Their hissing is heard from afar, and they seem to

15,000 houses and 15,000 shops, so that 150,000 souls would be a liberal
estimate. It appears now to contain from 30,000 to 50,000. Kinneir calls
it one of the most wretched cities in Persia. Such estimates of city population
are common enough still. Many books and many gentlemen in
India will still tell us that Benares contains half a million, and that
Lucknow before 1857 contained 700,000; the fact being, as regards
Benares, that by <i>census</i> and including its suburbs it contains 171,668;

<p><a id="Footnote_60" href="#FNanchor_60" class="label">[60]</a> The only manna I have known in India was exuded by a tamarisk;
but it appears to be produced on various shrubs in Persia and the adjoining
countries, camelthorns, tamarisks, and others. And one kind called
<i>Bed-kisht</i> is produced on a species of willow. (<i>Bed</i> signifies a <i>willow</i>.)
Some kinds of manna are used as sugar. (See <i>Pen. Cyc.</i> in v. <i>Manna</i>.)
This authority does not seem to recognize the agency of any insect in its
production. But Macdonald Kinneir (in his <i>Memoir of the Persian Empire</i>,
p. 329) has the following note. “Manna is exported from Moosh, on the
Euphrates [west of Lake Van] in considerable quantities. It is termed
<i>guz</i> by the Persians, and found in great quantities in Louristan, and in
the district of Khonsar in Irak. It is taken from a small shrub, in appearance
not unlike a funnel, about four feet in height and three in
diameter at the top. The <i>guz</i> is said to be produced by small insects,
which are seen to move in vast numbers under the small and narrow leaves
of the shrub.—These were always in motion, and continued to crawl
between the bark and the leaves. The <i>guz</i> is collected during the months
of August and September in the following manner. A vessel of an oval
form being placed under the bush as a receptacle, the leaves are beat
every third day with a crooked stick covered with leather. The manna
when first gathered has the tenacity and appearance of gum, but, when
exposed to the heat of 90° of Fahrenheit’s thermometer, it dissolves into
a liquid resembling honey. When mixed with sweetmeat its tenacity
resists the application of the knife, but when suddenly struck it shivers
into pieces.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_70" href="#FNanchor_70" class="label">[70]</a> Burnes describes the vast fields of soft sand, formed into ridges,
between Bokhara and the Oxus. Their uniformity is remarkable, all
having the shape of a horse-shoe, convex towards the north, from which
the prevailing wind blows. On this side they slope, inside they are precipitous.
The height is from fifteen to twenty feet. “The particles of
sand, moving from one mound to another, wheeling in the eddy or interior
of the semicircle, and having now and then, particularly under the rays
of the sun, much the look of water, an appearance, I imagine, which has
given rise to the opinion of moving sands in the desert.” (<i>Bokhara</i>, ii.

point immediately north of Malabar. Greater India extends from Malabar
very indefinitely to the eastward, for he makes it include Champa (Cambodia).
India Tertia is the east of Africa.</p>

<p>According to the old Portuguese geographer, whose “Summary of
Kingdoms,” etc., is given by Ramusio, <i>First India</i> (see text, next page),
ends at Mangalore, <i>Second India</i> at the Ganges.</p>

<p>Marco Polo reverses the titles given by our author. He makes Greater
India extend from Maabar (south part of the Coromandel coast) to Kesmacoran
(Kidj-mekrán or Mekrán), whilst Lesser India stretches from the
Coromandel to Champa. Abyssinia, Marco calls <i>Middle India</i>. (See <i>Murray’s
Polo</i>, pt. ii. ch. xxxvi.) Benjamin of Tudela speaks of “Middle India
which is called Aden.” Conti says all India is divided into three parts,
the first extending from Persia (Ormus?) to the Indus, the second from
the Indus to the Ganges, the third all beyond.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_76" href="#FNanchor_76" class="label">[76]</a> Five persons to <i>eat</i>, that is. But an English gentleman, who is a
coffee planter in the middle of Java, told me that he once cut a jack (the
fruit intended by the bishop), which it took <i>three</i> men to <i>carry</i>. That they
grow in Ceylon to 50 lbs. weight at least is testified by Cordiner and Sir
Emerson Tennent. The former says they grow there to two feet in length,
and to the same circumference, which is bigger than I ever saw them in
Bengal. The manner of growing is accurately described in the next
paragraph of the text.</p>

<p>The jack is, no doubt, the Indian fruit described by Pliny, Book xii.
ch. 12, as putting forth its fruit from the bark, and as being remarkable
for the sweetness of its juice, a single one containing enough to satisfy
four persons. The name of the tree, he says, is <i>pala</i>, and of the fruit
<i>Ariena</i>. The former is possibly the Tamul name, <i>Pila</i>, which is also one of
the Malabar names. If, however, Pliny derived the whole of his information
on this fruit, as he appears to derive part of it, from the historians of
the Alexandrian invasion, the name may be merely the Sanskrit <i>phala</i>, a
fruit, and it would be a comical illustration of the persistency of Indian
habits of mind. For a stranger in India asking the question, “What is
that?” would almost certainly at this day receive for reply, “<i>P’hal hai,
khudáwand!</i>” “It is a <i>fruit</i>, my lord!”</p>

<p>The name <i>jack</i>, which we give to the tree and its fruits, is one of that
large class of words which are neither English nor Hindustani, but <i>Anglo-Indian</i>,
and the origin of which is often very difficult to trace. Drury
gives <i>Pilavoo</i> as the Malayalim name, but I find that Rheede (<i>Hortus
Malabaricus</i>, vol. iii.) gives also <i>Tsjaka</i>; and Linschoten, too, says that
the jack is in Malabar called Iaca: so here we have doubtless the original.</p>

<p>I was long puzzled by the two species of our author, <i>Chaqui</i> and <i>Bloqui</i>.
There are, indeed, two well-known species of artocarpus giving fruits which
are both edible, and have a strong external resemblance, the jack and the
breadfruit. But the breadfruit is <i>not</i> as big, <i>not</i> as sweet, and does <i>not</i>
bear its fruit from the trunk and roots, but from twigs. Nor is it grown
in Malabar, though sometimes, Ainslie says (<i>Materia Medica</i>), imported
from Ceylon for sale. No <i>modern</i> authors that I can find make a clear
distinction of kinds of jack. But, on referring back, we find that all the
old authors, who really seem to have gone into these practical matters with
more freshness and sympathy in native tastes, do so. Thus Linschoten
says, “There are two sorts of them: the best are called <i>Girasal</i>, and the
common or least esteemed <i>Chambasal</i>, though in fashion and trees there is
no difference, save that the Girasals have a sweeter taste;” and his old
commentator, “the learned Doctor Paludanus, of Enckhuysen,” says, also,
there are “two sorts, and the best is called <i>Barca</i>, the other <i>Papa</i>, which
is not so good, and yet in handling is soft like the other.” Nearly three
hundred years earlier Ibn Batuta had said, that of the fruits of India “are
those termed <i>Shaki</i> and <i>Barki</i>, ... the fruit grows out from the bottom of
the tree, and that which grows nearest to the earth is called the Barki;
it is extremely sweet and well-flavoured in taste; what grows above this
is called the Shaki,” etc. Lastly, we have Rheede, speaking with authority,
“Ceterum arboris hujus ultra triginta numerantur species ratione
fructuum distinctæ, <i>quæ tamen omnes ad duo referentur genera</i>; quorum
alterius fructus qui carne succulentâ, gratissimi, mellinique saporis turgent,
<i>varaka</i>; at alterius, qui carne flaccidâ, molliori et minus sapidâ
referti sunt, <i>Tsjakapa</i> nuncupantur.” (iii. p. 19.) Drury, indeed, says,
“There are several varieties, but what is called the Honeyjack is by far the
sweetest and best.”</p>

<p>To conclude this long discourse on a short text, it seems certain that the
<i>Bloqui</i> of our author is the <i>Barki</i> of Ibn Batuta, the <i>Barka</i> of Paludanus,
the <i>Varaka</i> “mellini saporis” of Rheede, and the Honeyjack of Drury.
“He that desireth to see more hereof let him reade <i>Lodouicus Romanus</i>, in
his fifth Booke and fifteene Chapter of his Nauigatiouns, and <i>Christopherus
a Costa</i> in his Cap. of <i>Iaca</i>, and <i>Gracia ab Horto</i>, in the second
Booke and fourth Chapter,” saith the learned Paludanus,—and so say I,
by all means!</p>

as appears from Lee’s note (p. 104), and the latter translates it
“grape,” which is the meaning of that word I believe in <i>Arabic</i>. Our
author’s just description of the flavour of the mango is applicable, however,
only to the finer stocks, and seems to show that the “Bombay
mango” already existed in the thirteenth century. The mango is commonly
believed in Anglo-India to produce boils, which I see was also
the belief in Linschoten’s day. But I agree with his commentator, that,
at the time when the fruit is ripe, “by reason of the great heate and
season of the yeare—many doe fall into the forenamed diseases, although
they eate none of this fruite.”</p>

will see upon the trees the fruit of some large, of others small, of others
dry, and of others green. And this is the case always.” (See p. 176.)</p>

<p>The account of the coco-palm, though slightly mythicized, is substantially
correct. In the third year of the palm’s growth the fronds begin to
fall, a new frond appearing at the end of every month. Of these there
are twenty-eight, more or less, on a full-grown tree. On a single tree
there are about twelve branches, or spadices, of nuts. Most of the young
fruit falls off, only a few coming to perfection; but as from ten to fifteen
nuts <i>on an average</i> are produced on one branch, a single tree may produce
eighty to one hundred nuts every year. (<i>Drury’s Useful Plants of India.</i>)</p>

found from Malabar along the coast to Bengal, and thence down the
transgangetic coast through Burma and the great islands, and also up the
Ganges to Cawnpore, a little above which it ceases. The fruit is of no
value. The wood is much used for rafters, etc., and it is better than that
of any other Indian palm; but the tree is chiefly used for the derivation of
the liquor to which, as taken from this and other palms, we give the
slightly corrupted name of <i>toddy</i>, a name which in Scotland has received
a new application. It is the tree from which palm-sugar is most generally
made. The leaves are used for making fans (the typical fan being evidently
a copy of this leaf), for writing on, and in some places for thatching,
etc.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_86" href="#FNanchor_86" class="label">[86]</a> <i>Belluri</i> I conceive to be the <i>Caryota urens</i>, which, according to Rheede
(<i>Hortus Malabar.</i>, i.), is called by the Brahmans in Malabar <i>birala</i>. Most
of our author’s names seem to be Persian in form; but there is probably
no Persian name for this palm. Richardson, however, has “<i>barhal</i>, name
of a tree and its fruit.” This tree yields more toddy than any other palm,
as much as a hundred pints in twenty-four hours. Much sugar is made
from it, especially in Ceylon. It also affords a sago, and a fibre for fishing
lines, known in England as “Indian gut.” A woolly stuff found at the
springing of the fronds, is said by Drury to be used for caulking. I may
add that it makes an excellent <i>amadou</i> for smokers; but the specific name
does not come from this fact, as I have heard suggested, but from the
burning acridity of the fruit when applied to the tongue. The <i>caryota</i>,
with its enormous jagged fronds, and huge pendulous bunches of little
bead-like berries, is a very beautiful object. The fruit is actually used for
beads by the Mahomedans. Buchanan (<i>Mysore</i>, etc., ii, 454) says its leaves
are the favourite food of the elephant, and that its sugar is superior to
that of the palmyra, but inferior to that of the cocoa nut.</p>

shadow of which had a circumference of five hundred yards. Just about
half this size is the largest I have seen, near Hushyárpúr in the Northern
Punjab. It is remarkable in some of the largest of these trees, that you
cannot tell which has been the original and “mother-tree,” that having
probably decayed and disappeared. The age of these trees is sometimes
by no means so great as first impressions suggest. There is a very fine
one in the Botanic Garden at Calcutta, (its exact size I do not remember,
but the shade is not less than a hundred and eighty to two hundred feet
across), whereof the garden tradition runs, that it originated in Roxburgh’s

give the specific name. It is possible, however, that the bishop did not
mean <i>C. fistula</i>, but <i>cassia lignea</i>, an inferior cinnamon, which grows in
Malabar forests, and was at one time largely exported from Calicut and
the other ports. Barbosa mentions it as <i>canella selvatica</i>. Linschoten says

the cassia of Pliny. It is remarkable however that he says the choice

extravagantly high character for integrity and veracity to the Hindus,
a character not very often deserved by them, and never ascribed to them,
now-a-days. See some remarks on this subject in <i>Elphinstone’s History</i>,
book iii. ch. xi.</p>

<p>It is curious, however, that, with reference to the very district of Travancore,
which now includes Quilon, where the bishop’s experience must
have chiefly lain, two English Residents have borne testimony lamentably
opposed to his account of the character of the people in former times.
One of these declares that “he never knew a people so destitute of truth
and honesty, or so abandoned to vice and corruption”; the other asserts
that “in no part of the world are men to be found to whose habits and
affections the practice of vice is so familiar” (<i>Hamilton’s Desc. Hindost.</i>,
ii. 315).</p>

the Khilji sovereigns of Delhi, Alá-ud-din and Mubárik (<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 1310-1319).
The Khiljis were Turks by descent. Mooltan was at this time subject to
Delhi (<i>Elphinstone’s History</i>, pp. 343, 348, and <i>Briggs’s Ferishta</i>). But,
perhaps, the “not long since” has a wider import, and refers to the conquests
and iconoclasms of the great Mahmúd of Ghazni, 300 years before.
Indeed, he is here speaking of the Lesser India, <i>i.e.</i> of Sindh, Gujerat, and
the Konkan, the scene of some of Mahmúd’s most memorable expeditions.
Mahmúd coming from Ghazni would come <i>through</i> Multán, and indeed he

<p><a id="Footnote_117" href="#FNanchor_117" class="label">[117]</a> The black pepper vine is indigenous in the forests of Malabar and
Travancore (the districts which the Bishop has in his eye); and the
Malabar pepper is acknowledged to be the best that is produced. The
vines are planted at the base of trees with rough bark, the mango and
others, and will climb twenty or thirty feet if allowed. After being
gathered, the berries are dried on mats in the sun, turning from red to
black. Pepper was for ages <i>the</i> staple article of export to Europe from
India, and it was with it that Vasco de Gama loaded his ships on his first
voyage. A very interesting article on pepper will be found in that
treasury of knowledge, Crawfurd’s <i>Dictionary of the Archipelago</i>.</p>

<p>The Bishop’s mention of “long pepper” shews confusion, probably in
his amanuensis or copyist; for long pepper is the produce of a different
genus (<i>Chavica</i>), which is <i>not</i> a vine, but a shrub, whose stems are
annual. The chemical composition and properties are nearly the same as
those of black pepper. Crawfurd draws attention to the fact that, by
Pliny’s account, <i>piper longum</i> bore between three and four times the
price of black pepper in the Roman market. (<i>Drury</i> in voc.—<i>Crawfurd’s
Dict.</i>) Though long pepper is now cultivated in Malabar, it was not so,
or at least not <i>exported</i>, in the sixteenth century. Linschoten says expressly
that the “long pepper groweth onely in Bengala and Java.”
(p. 111.) Its price at Rome was probably therefore a fancy one, due to
its rarity. It is curious that Pliny supposed pepper to grow in pods, and
that the long pepper was the immature pod picked and prepared for the
market. He corrects a popular error that ginger was the root of the
pepper tree (bk. xii). Ibn Batuta, like our Bishop, contradicts what
“some have said, that they boil it in order to dry it,” as without foundation.
But their predecessor, R. Benjamin, says—“the pepper is originally
white, but when they collect it, they put it in basins and pour hot water
upon it; it is then exposed to the heat of the sun,” etc.</p>

<i>Pandi-koku</i>, “Pig-rat.” “This rat is found in many places on the
coast of Coromandel, in Mysore, and in several parts of Bengal between
Calcutta and Hurdwar. It is a most mischievous animal, burrows to a
great depth, and will pass under the foundations of granaries and store-houses
if not carefully laid.” (<i>General Hardwicke</i> in <i>Linnæan Trans.</i>, vii.,
quoted in <i>Pen. Cyc.</i>, article <i>Muridæ</i>.) The animal figured by Hardwicke
was a female; its total length was 26¼ inches, of which the tail was 13
inches; and the weight was 2 pounds 11½ ounces. This is not quite so
big as a fox, though the foxes in India <i>are</i> very small. As an exaggeration,
it is far from a parallel to that of Herodotus, who speaks (bk. iii.)

See also <i>Odoricus</i>, in Hakluyt, ii. 161. The singular narrative in the text
reminds us of Sir Jonah Barrington’s story of the Irish mower, who,
making a dig at a salmon in a pool with the butt end of his scythe, which
was over his shoulder, dropt his own head into the water. There is a
remarkably parallel story in <i>Ibn Batuta</i>. When he was at the court of
the pagan king of Mul-Java (which is certainly not Java, as the editors
make it, but, as I hope to show elsewhere, Cambodia, or some country on
the main in that quarter), he says, “I one day saw, in the assembly of
this prince, a man with a long knife in his hand, which he placed upon
his own neck; he then made a long speech, not a word of which I could
understand; he then firmly grasped the knife, and its sharpness, and the
force with which he urged it, were such that he severed his head from his
body, and it fell on the ground. I was wondering much at the circumstance,
when the king said to me: ‘Does any one among you do such a
thing as this?’ I answered, ‘I never saw one do so.’ He smiled, and
said: ‘These, our servants, do so out of their love to us.’ One who had
been present at the assembly, told me that the speech he made was a
declaration of his love to the sultan, and that on this account he had
killed himself, just as his father had done for the father of the present
king, and his grandfather for the king’s grandfather.” (<i>Lee’s Ibn Batuta</i>,
p. 205.) Also we are told by Abu Zaid al Hasan, in Reinaud’s <i>Relation
des Voyages faits par les Arabes</i>, etc. (Paris, 1845), how a young man of
India, tying his hair to a great elastic bamboo stem, which was pulled
down to the ground, cut his own head off, telling his friends to watch
that they might see and hear how the head would <i>laugh</i>, as it sprung aloft
with the resilient bamboo (i. 124). I wish I could relate, with the interesting
detail with which it was told to me, a narrative which I heard
from my friend Lieut.-Colonel Keatinge, V.C., of the Bombay Artillery.
When encamped near a certain sacred rock on the Nerbudda, in the province
of Nimar which was under his charge, a stalwart young man was
brought to him, who had come thither from a distance, for the purpose of
sacrificing himself by casting himself from the cliff, in fulfilment of a vow
made by his own mother before his birth, in case she should, after long
sterility, have a living son. After long remonstrance Colonel Keatinge
at last succeeded in convincing him that it would be quite lawful to sacrifice
a goat instead, and this having been done he departed with a relieved
mind.</p>

oriental tradition, which represents the aborigines under the aspect of
<i>Rakshasas</i> or Demons. The reference is to the various forest tribes of the
Peninsula, who represent either the Dravidian races unmodified by civilization,
(whether Hindu or pre-Hindu), or some yet antecedent races. Dubois,
speaking generally of the wild forest tribes of the south, says, “In
the rainy season they shelter themselves in caverns, hollow trees, and
clefts of the rocks; and in fine weather they keep the open field. They
are almost entirely naked. The women wear nothing to conceal their
nakedness but some leaves of trees stitched together, and bound round
their waists,” etc. (473.) And Mr. Markham describes the Poliars, a race
of wild and timid men of the woods in the Pulney Hills, east of Cochin,
who are possibly the very people whom Jordanus had in his eye, as being
said to have no habitations, but to run through the jungle from place to
place, to sleep under rocks, and live on wild honey and roots. They occasionally
trade with the peasantry, who place cotton and grain on some
stone, and the wild creatures, as soon as the strangers are out of sight,
take these and put honey in their place. But they will let no one come
near them. (<i>Peru and India</i>, p. 404.) These wild races were no doubt in
the mind’s eye of a little Hindu, who, during the examination of a native
school by a late governor of Madras (now again occupying an eminent
position in India), on being asked what became of the original inhabitants
of Britain at the Saxon conquest? replied, “They fled into Wales and
Cornwall, and other remote parts, where they exist as a wild and barbarous
people to this day!” The little Hindu was not aware that—</p>

stone vessels filled with water (as is often done), so that he considered it
quite isolated and safe. On opening the case some time after he found
the harness ruined, and on looking behind he saw that the white ants
had actually projected their “crust” across the gap from the wall, so
as to reach their prey by a tubular bridge. Here is engineering

<p><a id="Footnote_146" href="#FNanchor_146" class="label">[146]</a> “<i>Ut ego audivi.</i>” Ambiguum est, an ipse episcopus D⸺m loquentem
audivisset? Not many years ago, an eccentric gentleman wrote from
Sikkim to the secretary of the Asiatic Society in Calcutta, stating that,
on the snows of the mountains there, were found certain mysterious footsteps,
<i>more than thirty or forty paces asunder</i>, which the natives alleged
to be <i>Shaitan’s</i>. The writer at the same time offered, if Government
would give him leave of absence for a certain period, etc., to go and trace
the author of these mysterious vestiges, and thus this strange creature
would be discovered <i>without any expense to Government</i>. The notion of
catching Shaitan without any expense to Government was a sublime piece
of Anglo-Indian tact, but the offer was not accepted. Our author had,
however, in view probably the strange cry of the Devil-bird, as it is called
in Ceylon. “The Singhalese regard it literally with horror, and its
scream by night in the vicinity of a village is bewailed as the harbinger
of impending calamity.” “Its ordinary note is a magnificent clear shout,
like that of a human being, and which can be heard at a great distance,
and has a fine effect in the silence of the closing night. It has another
cry like that of a hen just caught; but the sounds which have earned for
it its bad name, and which I have heard but once to perfection, are indescribable,
the most appalling that can be imagined, and scarcely to be
heard without shuddering; I can only compare it to a boy in torture,
whose screams are stopped by being strangled.” Mr. Mitford, from whom
Sir E. Tennent quotes the last passage, considers it to be a <i>Podargus</i> or
night-hawk, rather than the brown owl as others have supposed. (<i>Tennent’s
Nat. Hist. of Ceylon</i>, 246-8.)</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_147" href="#FNanchor_147" class="label">[147]</a> Champa is the Malay name of the coast of Cambodia, and appears in
some form in our maps. Jordanus may have derived his information about
those countries from his brother friar, Odoricus, who visited Champa, and
mentions the king’s having 10,004 elephants. Late travellers in Cambodia
use almost the expression in the text in speaking of the habitual
employment of elephants in that country (<i>e.g.</i>, see Mr. King, in <i>Jour. Geog.
Soc.</i> for 1860, p. 178).</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_148" href="#FNanchor_148" class="label">[148]</a> This is evidently drawn from the life. Compare the account of elephant

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_149" href="#FNanchor_149" class="label">[149]</a> The number <i>twelve</i> is only general and conventional. Ibn Batuta
says there were twelve kings in Malabar alone, and even a greater number
are alluded to by some of the old travellers. It is extremely difficult to
trace these kingdoms, both from the looseness of the statements and
want of accessible histories of the states of Southern India, and from
that absence of any distinction between really substantial monarchies
and mere principalities of small account, which may be noticed in Polo
and the other travellers of the time as well as in our author.</p>

<p>Telenc, however, he speaks of as a potent and great kingdom. This
must have been the kingdom of interior Telingana, called <i>Andra</i>, the
capital of which was Warangól, eighty miles north-east of Hyderabad, and
which was powerful and extensive at the end of the thirteenth century.
It was shortly afterwards invaded by the armies of the king of Delhi; the
capital was taken in 1332, and the sovereignty at a later date merged in
the Mussulman kingdom of Golkonda.</p>

<p>There does not seem to have been any very great kingdom in the <span class="smcap">Mahratta</span>
country at this time, and perhaps this is the reason why he there
speaks of the kingdom, not of the king. The most powerful princes
were the rajas of Deogiri (afterwards Daulutabad), of the Yadu family.
Their dynasty was subverted by the Mahommedans in 1317. I believe
there is no mention of the Mahrattas by the Mussulman historians till
just about our author’s time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Columbum</span>, or Kulam, we have disposed of in the preface. We see
here that the kingdom included (part at least of) <span class="smcap">Mohebar</span>, the Maabar
of Marco Polo and of Ibn Batuta, <i>i.e.</i>, the southern regions of the Coromandel
coast; (see Preface, p. xvi). The name is apparently Arabic (<i>Ma’abar</i>—a
ferry), in reference to the passage or ferry to Ceylon. The king, whose name
was <i>Lingua</i>, may probably have been connected with the sect of the <i>Lingáyets</i>
still existing in Southern India, whose members wear a representation of
the Lingam or Sivaite emblem round their necks, and have many peculiar
practices. He was certainly a Nair, as appears from what Jordanus has
said of the law of succession. And among the rajas of Coorg, who were
both Nairs and Lingáyets, we find the name Linga borne by several
during the last century. (Compare <i>Markham’s Peru and India</i>; <i>Hamilton’s
Hindostan</i>, ii. 288, etc.)</p>

<p>I cannot trace any particulars of a king of Molepoor or Molepatam.
But the only pearl fishery on the Indian main is at <i>Tuticorin</i>, about ninety
miles north-east of Cape Comorin, and near this there is a place given by
Hamilton, called Mooloopetta (= Mooloopatam), which may probably be
the seat of the king alluded to. He was most likely the same as the king
of Cail, spoken of by Marco Polo; that place being apparently now represented
by Coilpatam, a small seaport of Tinnevelly, in this immediate
vicinity. This appears from Barbosa, who, at the beginning of the sixteenth
century, states precisely that Cail was ninety miles from Cape
Comorin, and that it was the seat of a great pearl market and fishery.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Batigala</span>, or Batikala, which, he says, had a Saracen king, is a port of
Canara, fifty-five miles north of Mangalore; it is called Batcul, or Batcole,
in English maps. It is not mentioned by Ibn Batuta, the nearest authority
in time; but he does state that at Hinaur (Hunáwur or Onore), a
port a little to the north of Baticala, the people were Moslem, and their
king “one of the best of princes,” one <i>Jamál ad-Dín Mahommed Ibn Hasan</i>,
to whom Malabar generally paid tribute, dreading his bravery by sea,
(which means, I suppose, that this excellent prince was a pirate). Very
probably this was the king of Batigala to whom Jordanus refers. He was,
however, himself “subject to an infidel king, whose name was Horaib”
(<i>Lee’s Ibn Batuta</i>, p. 166), doubtless the king of Narsinga or Bisnagur,
whom Jordanus omits to mention. Two centuries later Barbosa describes
Batticala as a great place, where many merchants trafficked, and where
were many <i>Moors</i> and Gentiles, great merchants. And the “<i>Summary of
Kingdoms</i>,” in <i>Ramusio</i>, says the king of Baticula was then a Gentile Canarese,
“greater than him of Honor;” the governor, however, being a
Moorish eunuch, named Caipha. Later in the sixteenth century, Vincent
Le Blanc describes it as still a fine place, and one of great trade.</p>

<p>The great king of Molebar, or <span class="smcap">Malabar</span>, is, I suppose, the Samudra
Raja, or Zamorin of the Portuguese, whose capital was at Calicut.</p>

<p><i>Singuyli</i> is a nut hard to crack. Our friar’s contemporary, Odoricus,
calls the two chief ports of the pepper country in his day <i>Flandrina</i> and
<i>Cyncilim</i>. The former is no doubt the <i>Fandaraina</i> of Ibn Batuta, “a large
and beautiful place,” the Colam Pandarani of Ramusio’s Geographer,
lying a little north of Calicut, but not marked in our modern maps. (The
lying Mandevill says it was called Flandrina after Flanders by Ogero
the Dane, who conquered those parts!) Cyncilim I suspect to be <i>Kain
Kulam</i> or <i>Cai Colam</i>, one of the old ports a few miles north of Quilon, and
formerly a little kingdom. Singuyli is not very like Kain Kulam, but
Cyncilim is somewhat like both; and the position in which he mentions
it, between Calicut and Quilon, would suit.</p>

<p>As for <i>Chopa</i>, I suspect it to be a misreading (Chãpa, read as Chopa),
for <span class="smcap">Champa</span>, whereby he seems to mean hazily India ultra Gangem in general,
though the name belongs to Cambodia.</p>

both sexes; and in North Africa, where the animals are kept for the purpose,
the secretion is scraped from the pouch with an iron spatula, about
twice a week (<i>Penny Cyclop.</i>). But the text is confirmed by Sir E. Tennent,
who says that the Tamils in Northern Ceylon, who also keep the
animal for its musk, collect this from the wooden bars of the cage, on
which it rubs itself (<i>Nat. Hist. Ceylon</i>, p. 32).</p>

It is found usually in small pieces, but some times in lumps of fifty to one

dog” (iii. c. 16). And Ibn Batuta, describing the people of “Barahnakár”
(under which name he seems to have mixed up the stories of the
Andamans which he had heard, with his experience of some port on the
main at which he had touched on his way from Bengal to Sumatra), says,
“Their men are of the same form with ourselves, except that their mouths
are like those of dogs; <i>but the women have mouths like other folks</i>” (<i>Lee’s

Ptolemy, whose <i>Agmatæ</i> (compare Polo’s <i>Angaman</i>) and adjacent islands,

<p><a id="Footnote_166" href="#FNanchor_166" class="label">[166]</a> From Rubruquis to Père Huc all travellers in Buddhistic Tartary and
Thibet have been struck by the extraordinary resemblance of many features
of the ecclesiastical system and ritual to those of the Roman Church.
Father Grueber, in 1661, speaking of the veneration paid to the Lama,
ascribes it to “the manifest deceits of the devil, who has transferred the
veneration due to the sole Vicar of Christ to the superstitious worship of
barbarous nations, as he has also, in his innate malignity, parodied the
other mysteries of the Christian faith.” (In Kircher’s <i>China Illustrata</i>.)
Huc and Gabet say, “The crosier, the mitre, the dalmatica, the cope or
pluvial (which the Grand Lamas wear in travelling), the double-choired
liturgy, the psalmody, the exorcisms, the censer ... the benedictions ...
the rosary, the ecclesiastical celibate, the spiritual retreats, the worship
of saints; fasts, processions, holy water; in all these numerous particulars
do the Buddhists coincide with us.” The cardinal’s red hat among
the Lamas is a modern fact. (Abridged from a paper by the present
writer in <i>Blackwood</i> for March 1852.)</p>

Polo says that if the chief lord died a hundred days journey from this
cemetery, which was in the Altai mountains, his body must be carried
thither. Also “when the bodies of the Khans are carried to these mountains,
the conductors put to the sword all the men whom they meet on
the road, saying, ‘Go and serve the great lord in the other world;’ and
they do the same to the horses, killing also for that purpose the best he
has” (ii. 45).</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_177" href="#FNanchor_177" class="label">[177]</a> One of the best accounts of Baku is in the <i>Travels</i> of George Forster,
of the Bengal Civil Service, who came overland from India by the Caspian
in 1784. There were at that time a considerable number of Multán Hindus
at Baku, where they had long been established, and were the chief merchants
of Shirwán. The <i>Átish-gáh</i>, or Place of Fire, was a square of about
thirty yards, surrounded by a low wall, and containing many apartments,
in each of which was a small jet of sulphureous fire issuing through a
furnace or funnel, “constructed in the form of a Hindu altar.” The fire
was used for worship, cookery, and warmth. On closing the funnel the
fire was extinguished, when a hollow sound was heard, accompanied by a
strong and cold current of air. Exclusive of these there was a large jet
from a natural cleft, and many small jets outside the wall, one of which
was used by the Hindus for burning the dead.</p>

<p>The whole country round Baku has at times, according to Kinneir,
the appearance of being enveloped in flame, and during moonlight nights
in November and December a bright blue light is observed to cover the
whole western range. My friend Colonel Patrick Stewart, who was lately
for some days at Baku, tells me that it is often possible to “set the sea
on fire”, <i>i.e.</i>, the gaseous exhalations on the surface. He says the Hindus
are now only two or three, one of whom, a very old man, had lost the
power of speaking his native tongue.</p>

<p>The quantity of naphtha procured in the plain near the city is enormous.
Some of the wells are computed to give from 1000 to 1500 pounds
a day. It is discriminated as <i>black</i> and <i>white</i>. The white naphtha appears
to be used chiefly as a remedy for allaying pains and inflammations.
The flat roofs of Baku are covered with the black naphtha, and it is made
into balls with sand as a fuel. (See <i>Forster’s Journey from Bengal to England</i>,
London, 1798; and <i>Macdonald Kinneir’s Geog. Memoir of the Persian
Empire</i>, p. 359.)</p>

<p>From Haxthausen we learn that the Átish-gáh or Átish-jáh has been
altered since Forster’s time. The flame now issues from a central opening,
and from four circumjacent hollow pillars within the temple, which is a
building of a triangular form, and of about one hundred and ninety paces
to the side, erected by a Hindu merchant in the present century. The
flame is described as being about four feet high, bright, and “waving
heavily to and fro against the dark sky, a truly marvellous and spectral
sight.” The Átish-gáh of Baku appears to be the “Castle of the Fire-worshippers”
spoken of by Polo (ii. 9). He says they revere the fire “as
a god, and use it for burning all their sacrifices; and when at any time
it goes out, they repair to that well, where the fire is never extinguished,
and from it bring a fresh supply.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_178" href="#FNanchor_178" class="label">[178]</a> Some trace of the practice here alluded to is to be found among the
Nestorians. “Once a year there is a kind of <i>Agapæ</i> to commemorate the
departed, in all the mountain villages. For days previous such families
as intend to contribute to the feast are busily engaged in preparing their
offerings. These consist of lambs and bread, which are brought into the
church-yard; and after the people have communicated of the holy Eucharist,
the priest goes forth, cuts several locks of wool off the fleeces, and
throws them into a censer. Whilst a deacon swings this to and fro in
presence of the assembled guests, the priest recites the following anthem:</p>

<p>“‘<span class="smcap">The following is to be said over the Lambs that are slain
in sacrifice for the dead</span>:—</p>

<p class="center">...</p>

<p>“‘When ye present oblations and offer pure sacrifices, and bring lambs
to be slain, ye should first call the priests, who shall sign them with the
sign of the cross before they are slain, and say over them these words:
He was brought as a lamb to the slaughter,’” etc.</p>

<p>... “‘O Lord, let the oblation which thy servants have offered
before thee this day be acceptable, as was that of faithful Abraham the
righteous, who vowed his son as an oblation, and stretched out the knife
upon his throat, <i>whereupon he saw a lamb hung on a tree like his life-giving
Lord who was crucified</i>,’” etc. (<i>Rev. G. P. Badger’s Nestorians</i>, i. 229.)</p>

<p>See also Dr. Stanley’s account of the cruciform spit used by the Samaritans
in roasting the Paschal lamb, in the notes to his <i>Sermons before the
Prince of Wales</i>.</p>

<p>The Yezidís also have some mixture of Christian names in their superstitions,
and sacrifice to Christ. Of the Ossetes of the Caucasus also we
are told that the majority are nominally Christians, but in fact semi-pagans,
and rarely baptized. They offer sacrifices of bread and flesh in
sacred groves, and observe the Christian festivals with various sacrifices,
<i>e.g.</i>, a <i>lamb at Easter</i>, a pig on New Year’s Day, an ox at Michaelmas, a
goat at Christmas. Both Georgians and Armenians are said still to be
addicted to the practice of sacrifice in their churches. (<i>Haxthausen’s
Transcaucasia</i>, p. 397.)</p>

cavaliers of the Caucasian countries; they stand in the same relative
position as the Goths and Moors of Spain.” “The bases and principles
of the organization and general condition of the Georgian people bore
great resemblance to those of the Germanic race, comprising a feudal
constitution, perfectly analogous to the Romano-Germanic. In this <i>warlike
country</i> the Christian hierarchy was constituted in a perfectly analogous
manner to the temporal feudal state,” etc. (<i>Haxthausen</i>, pp. 113,
117.)</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_186" href="#FNanchor_186" class="label">[186]</a> I cannot explain all these names. But the author’s reference is to
the several empires into which the vast conquests of Chengiz Khan were
partitioned among his descendants. 1. <i>Cathay</i>, or all the eastern part of
the empire, including China, with a paramount authority over all, fell to
Okkodai and his successors, the “Great Khans” or “Great Tartars” of
our author. 2. <i>Kipchak</i>, or Comania, all the country westward of the
Ural river, through the south of Russia, fell eventually to Batu, the
grandson of Chengiz, whose invasion, penetrating to Silesia and Hungary,
struck terror into Europe. This is the Gatzaria of the text; Khazaria
being properly the country adjoining the Sea of Azoph, and including the
Crimea. The expression “now of Osbet” appears to refer to Uzbeg, who
was Khan of Kipchak from 1313 to 1340. 3. <i>Jagatai</i> (Elchigaday = El
Jagatai, I suppose) was Transoxiana, lying between the first and second
empires. It was so called from Jagatai, the son of Chengiz, to whom it
fell. <i>Kaidu</i>, the grandson of Jagatai, according to Marco Polo, was the
ruler of this country in the time of that traveller. Dua and Capac I
cannot explain. 4. <i>Persia.</i> The second and third are of course the
“other two empires of the Tartars” mentioned in the text. (See
D’Avezac’s “Notice of Old Travels in Tartary” in <i>Recueil de Voyages</i>, vol.
iv.; and Introduction to <i>Erskine’s Translation of Baber’s Memoirs</i>, etc.)</p>

Arab mariners, though ultimately from the Malay <i>ajong</i>, a ship.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_193" href="#FNanchor_193" class="label">[193]</a> According to Beckman, the ancients were not acquainted with real
alum. He says it was discovered by the orientals, who established works
in the thirteenth century in Syria (apparently at Rukka or Rochha, east
of Aleppo, whence the name of <i>Roch-alum</i>, still in use). The best now
comes from the neighbourhood of Civita Vecchia. The method of manufacture
in England and Scotland is to mix broken alum slate with fuel,
and to set it on fire. When combustion is over the residual mixture is
lixiviated with water; a solution of the earthy salt being obtained, potash
salts are added, and crystals of alum are the result. (<i>Penny Cyclop.</i> and
<i>Macculloch’s Comm. Dict.</i>)</p>

(to-morrow morning). (B.)</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
